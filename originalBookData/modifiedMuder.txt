murder on the orient expresspart ithe facts1an important passenger on the taurus expressit was five oclock on a winters morning in syria
alongside the platform at aleppo stood the train grandly designated in railway guides as the taurus express
it consisted of a kitchen and diningcar a sleepingcar and two local coaches
by the step leading up into the sleepingcar stood a young french lieutenant resplendent in uniform conversing with a small man muffled up to the ears of whom nothing was visible but a pinktipped nose and the two points of an upwardcurled moustache
it was freezingly cold and this job of seeing off a distinguished stranger was not one to be envied but lieutenant dubosc performed his part manfully
graceful phrases fell from his lips in polished french
not that he knew what it was all about
there had been rumours of course as there always were in such cases
the generalshis generalstemper had grown worse and worse
and then there had come this belgian strangerall the way from england it seemed
there had been a weeka week of curious tensity
and then certain things had happened
a very distinguished officer had committed suicide another had suddenly resigned anxious faces had suddenly lost their anxiety certain military precautions were relaxed
and the general lieutenant duboscs own particular general had suddenly looked ten years younger
dubosc had overheard part of a conversation between him and the stranger
you have saved us mon cher said the general emotionally his great white moustache trembling as he spoke
you have saved the honour of the french armyyou have averted much bloodshed
how can i thank you for acceding to my request
to have come so farto which the stranger by name m hercule poirot had made a fitting reply including the phrasebut indeed do i not remember that once you saved my life
and then the general had made another fitting reply to that disclaiming any merit for that past service and with more mention of france of belgium of glory of honour and of such kindred things they had embraced each other heartily and the conversation had ended
as to what it had all been about lieutenant dubosc was still in the dark but to him had been delegated the duty of seeing off m poirot by the taurus express and he was carrying it out with all the zeal and ardour befitting a young officer with a promising career ahead of him
today is sunday said lieutenant dubosc
tomorrow monday evening you will be in stamboul
it was not the first time he had made this observation
conversations on the platform before the departure of a train are apt to be somewhat repetitive in character
that is so agreed m poirot
and you intend to remain there a few days i think
mais oui
stamboul it is a city i have never visited
it would be a pity to pass throughcomme ca
he snapped his fingers descriptively
nothing pressesi shall remain there as a tourist for a few days
la sainte sophie it is very fine said lieutenant dubosc who had never seen it
a cold wind came whistling down the platform
both men shivered
lieutenant dubosc managed to cast a surreptitious glance at his watch
five minutes to fiveonly five minutes more
fancying that the other man had noticed his glance he hastened once more into speech
there are few people travelling this time of year he said glancing up at the windows of the sleepingcar above them
that is so agreed m poirot
let us hope you will not be snowed up in the taurus
that happens
it has occurred yes
not this year as yet
let us hope then said m poirot
the weather reports from europe they are bad
very bad
in the balkans there is much snow
in germany too i have heard
eh bien said lieutenant dubosc hastily as another pause seemed to be about to occur
tomorrow evening at sevenforty you will be in constantinople
yes said m poirot and went on desperately la sainte sophie i have heard it is very fine
magnificent i believe
above their heads the blinds of one of the sleepingcar compartments was pushed aside and a young woman looked out
mary debenham had had little sleep since she left baghdad on the preceding thursday
neither in the train to kirkuk nor in the rest house at mosul nor last night on the train had she slept properly
now weary of lying wakeful in the hot stuffiness of her overheated compartment she got up and peered out
this must be aleppo
nothing to see of course
just a long poorly lighted platform with loud furious altercations in arabic going on somewhere
two men below her window were talking french
one was a french officer the other was a little man with enormous moustaches
she smiled faintly
she had never seen anyone quite so heavily muffled up
it must be very cold outside
that was why they heated the train so terribly
she tried to force the window down lower but it would not go
the wagon lit conductor had come up to the two men
the train was about to depart he said
monsieur had better mount
the little man removed his hat
what an eggshaped head he had
in spite of her preoccupations mary debenham smiled
a ridiculouslooking little man
the sort of little man one could never take seriously
lieutenant dubosc was saying his parting speech
he had thought it out beforehand and had kept it till the last minute
it was a very beautiful polished speech
not to be outdone m poirot replied in kind
en voiture monsieur said the wagon lit conductor
with an air of infinite reluctance m poirot climbed aboard the train
the conductor climbed after him
m poirot waved his hand
lieutenant dubosc came to the salute
the train with a terrific jerk moved slowly forward
enfin
murmured m hercule poirot
brrrrrrrr said lieutenant dubosc realising to the full how cold he was
voila monsieur
the conductor displayed to poirot with a dramatic gesture the beauty of his sleeping compartment and the neat arrangement of his luggage
the little valise of monsieur i have put it here
his outstretched hand was suggestive
hercule poirot placed in it a folded note
merci monsieur
the conductor became brisk and businesslike
i have the tickets of monsieur
i will also take the passport please
monsieur breaks his journey in stamboul i understand
m poirot assented
there are not many people travelling i imagine
he said
no monsieur
i have only two other passengersboth english
a colonel from india and a young english lady from baghdad
monsieur requires anything
monsieur demanded a small bottle of perrier
five oclock in the morning is an awkward time to board a train
there were still two hours before dawn
conscious of an inadequate nights sleep and of a delicate mission successfully accomplished m poirot curled up in a corner and fell asleep
when he awoke it was halfpast nine he sallied forth to the restaurant car in search of hot coffee
there was only one occupant at the moment obviously the young english lady referred to by the conductor
she was tall slim and darkperhaps twentyeight years of age
there was a kind of cool efficiency in the way she was eating her breakfast and in the way she called to the attendant to bring her more coffee which bespoke a knowledge of the world and of travelling
she wore a darkcoloured travelling dress of some thin material eminently suitable for the heated atmosphere of the train
m hercule poirot having nothing better to do amused himself by studying her without appearing to do so
she was he judged the kind of young woman who could take care of herself with perfect ease wherever she went
she had poise and efficiency
he rather liked the severe regularity of her features and the delicate pallor of her skin
he liked the burnished black head with its neat waves of hair and her eyescool impersonal and grey
but she was he decided just a little too efficient to be what he called jolie femme
presently another person entered the restaurant car
this was a tall man of between forty and fifty lean of figure brown of skin with hair slightly grizzled round the temples
the colonel from india said poirot to himself
the newcomer gave a little bow to the girl
morning miss debenham
good morning colonel arbuthnot
the colonel was standing with a hand on the chair opposite her
any objections
he asked
of course not
sit down
well you know breakfast isnt always a chatty meal
i should hope not
but i dont bite
the colonel sat down
boy he called in peremptory fashion
he gave an order for eggs and coffee
his eyes rested for a moment on hercule poirot but they passed on indifferently
poirot reading the english mind correctly knew that he had said to himself
only some damned foreigner
true to their nationality the two english people were not chatty
they exchanged a few brief remarks and presently the girl rose and went back to her compartment
at lunch time the other two again shared a table and again they both completely ignored the third passenger
their conversation was more animated than at breakfast
colonel arbuthnot talked of the punjab and occasionally asked the girl a few questions about baghdad where it became clear she had been in a post as governess
in the course of conversation they discovered some mutual friends which had the immediate effect of making them more friendly and less stiff
they discussed old tommy somebody and old reggie someone else
the colonel inquired whether she was going straight through to england or whether she was stopping in stamboul
no im going straight on
isnt that rather a pity
i came out this way two years ago and spent three days in stamboul then
oh
i see
well i may say im very glad you are going right through because i am
he made a kind of clumsy little bow flushing a little as he did so
he is susceptible our colonel thought hercule poirot to himself with some amusement
the train it is as dangerous as a sea voyage
miss debenham said evenly that that would be very nice
her manner was slightly repressive
the colonel hercule poirot noticed accompanied her back to her compartment
later they passed through the magnificent scenery of the taurus
as they looked down towards the cilician gates standing in the corridor side by side a sigh came suddenly from the girl
poirot was standing near them and heard her murmurits so beautiful
i wishi wishyes
i wish i could enjoy it
arbuthnot did not answer
the square line of his jaw seemed a little sterner and grimmer
i wish to heaven you were out of all this he said
hush please
hush
oh
its all right
he shot a slightly annoyed glance in poirots direction
then he went on but i dont like the idea of your being a governessat the beck and call of tyrannical mothers and their tiresome brats
she laughed with just a hint of uncontrol in the sound
oh
you mustnt think that
the downtrodden governess is quite an exploded myth
i can assure you that its the parents who are afraid of being bullied by me
they said no more
arbuthnot was perhaps ashamed of his outburst
rather an odd little comedy that i watch here said poirot to himself thoughtfully
he was to remember that thought of his later
they arrived at konya that night about halfpast eleven
the two english travellers got out to stretch their legs pacing up and down the snowy platform
m poirot was content to watch the teeming activity of the station through a window pane
after about ten minutes however he decided that a breath of air would not perhaps be a bad thing after all
he made careful preparations wrapping himself in several coats and mufflers and encasing his neat boots in goloshes
thus attired he descended gingerly to the platform and began to pace its length
he walked out beyond the engine
it was the voices which gave him the clue to the two indistinct figures standing in the shadow of a traffic van
arbuthnot was speaking
marythe girl interrupted him
not now
not now
when its all over
when its behind usthendiscreetly m poirot turned away
he wondered

he would hardly have recognised the cool efficient voice of miss debenham
curious he said to himself
the next day he wondered whether perhaps they had quarrelled
they spoke little to each other
the girl he thought looked anxious
there were dark circles under her eyes
it was about halfpast two in the afternoon when the train came to a halt
heads were poked out of windows
a little knot of men were clustered by the side of the line looking and pointing at something under the diningcar
poirot leaned out and spoke to the wagon lit conductor who was hurrying past
the man answered and poirot drew back his head and turning almost collided with mary debenham who was standing just behind him
what is the matter
she asked rather breathlessly in french
why are we stopping
it is nothing mademoiselle
it is something that has caught fire under the diningcar
nothing serious
it is put out
they are now repairing the damage
there is no danger i assure you
she made a little abrupt gesture as though she were waving the idea of danger aside as something completely unimportant
yes yes i understand that
but the time
the time
yes this will delay us
it is possibleyes agreed poirot
but we cant afford delay
this train is due in at 655 and one has to cross the bosphorus and catch the simplon orient express on the other side at nine oclock
if there is an hour or two of delay we shall miss the connection
it is possible yes he admitted
he looked at her curiously
the hand that held the window bar was not quite steady her lips too were trembling
does it matter to you very much mademoiselle
he asked
yes
yes it does
ii must catch that train
she turned away from him and went down the corridor to join colonel arbuthnot
her anxiety however was needless
ten minutes later the train started again
it arrived at haydapassar only five minutes late having made up time on the journey
the bosphorus was rough and m poirot did not enjoy the crossing
he was separated from his travelling companions on the boat and did not see them again
on arrival at the galata bridge he drove straight to the tokatlian hotel
2the tokatlian hotelat the tokatlian hercule poirot asked for a room with bath
then he stepped over to the concierges desk and inquired for letters
there were three waiting for him and a telegram
his eyebrows rose a little at the sight of the telegram
it was unexpected
he opened it in his usual neat unhurried fashion
the printed words stood out clearly
development you predicted in kassner case has come unexpectedly
please return immediately
voila ce qui est embetant muttered poirot vexedly
he glanced up at the clock
i shall have to go on tonight he said to the concierge
at what time does the simplon orient leave
at nine oclock monsieur
can you get me a sleeper
assuredly monsieur
there is no difficulty this time of year
the trains are almost empty
firstclass or second
first
tres bien monsieur
how far are you going
to london
bien monsieur
i will get you a ticket to london and reserve your sleepingcar accommodation in the stamboulcalais coach
poirot glanced at the clock again
it was ten minutes to eight
i have time to dine
but assuredly monsieur
the little belgian nodded
he went over and cancelled his room order and crossed the hall to the restaurant
as he was giving his order to the waiter a hand was placed on his shoulder
ah mon vieux but this is an unexpected pleasure
said a voice behind him
the speaker was a short stout elderly man his hair cut en brosse
he was smiling delightedly
poiret sprang up
m
bouc
m
poirot
m bouc was a belgian a director of the compagnie internationale des wagons lits and his acquaintance with the former star of the belgian police force dated back many years
you find yourself far from home mon cher said m bouc
a little affair in syria
ah
and you return homewhen
tonight
splendid
i too
that is to say i go as far as lausanne where i have affairs
you travel on the simplon orient i presume
yes
i have just asked them to get me a sleeper
it was my intention to remain here some days but i have
received a telegram recalling me to england on important business
ah
sighed m bouc
les affairesles affaires
but you you are at the top of the tree nowadays mon vieux
some little success i have had perhaps
hercule poirot tried to look modest but failed signally
m bouc laughed
we will meet later he said
hercule poirot addressed himself to the task of keeping his moustaches out of the soup
that difficult task accomplished he glanced round him whilst waiting for the next course
there were only about half a dozen people in the restaurant and of those half dozen there were only two that interested hercule poirot
these two sat at a table not far away
the younger was a likeablelooking young man of thirty clearly an american
it was however not he but his companion who had attracted the little detectives attention
he was a man perhaps of between sixty and seventy
from a little distance he had the bland aspect of a philanthropist
his slightly bald head his domed forehead the smiling mouth that displayed a very white set of false teethall seemed to speak of a benevolent personality
only the eyes belied this assumption
they were small deepset and crafty
not only that
as the man making some remark to his young companion glanced across the room his gaze stopped on poirot for a moment and just for that second there was a strange malevolence an unnatural tensity in the glance
then he rose
pay the bill hector he said
his voice was slightly husky in tone
it had a queer soft dangerous quality
when poirot rejoined his friend in the lounge the other two men were just leaving the hotel
their luggage was being brought down
the younger was supervising the process
presently he opened the glass door and saidquite ready now mr
ratchett
the elder man grunted an assent and passed out
eh bien said poirot
what do you think of those two
they are americans said m bouc
assuredly they are americans
i meant what did you think of their personalities
the young man seemed quite agreeable
and the other
to tell you the truth my friend i did not care for him
he produced on me an unpleasant impression
and you
hercule poirot was a moment in replying
when he passed me in the restaurant he said at last i had a curious impression
it was as though a wild animalan animal savage but savage
you understandhad passed me by
and yet he looked altogether of the most respectable
precisement
the bodythe cageis everything of the most respectablebut through the bars the wild animal looks out
you are fanciful mon vieux said m bouc
it may be so
but i could not rid myself of the impression that evil had passed me by very close
that respectable american gentleman
that respectable american gentleman
well said m bouc cheerfully it may be so
there is much evil in the world
at that moment the door opened and the concierge came towards them
he looked concerned and apologetic
it is extraordinary monsieur he said to poirot
there is not one firstclass sleeping berth to be had on the train
comment
cried m bouc
at this time of year
ah without doubt there is some party of journalistsof politicians
i dont know sir said the concierge turning to him respectfully
but thats how it is
well well
m bouc turned to poirot
have no fear my friend
we will arrange something
there is always one compartment the no
16 which is not engaged
the conductor sees to that
he smiled then glanced up at the clock
come he said it is time we started
at the station m bouc was greeted with respectful empressement by the brownuniformed wagon lit conductor
good evening monsieur
your compartment is the no
1
he called to the porters and they wheeled their load halfway along the carriage on which the tin plates proclaimed its destinationistanbul trieste calaisyou are full up tonight i hear
it is incredible monsieur
all the world elects to travel tonight
all the same you must find room for this gentleman here
he is a friend of mine
he can have the no
16
it is taken monsieur
what
the no
16
a glance of understanding passed between them and the conductor smiled
he was a tall sallow man of middle age
but yes monsieur
as i told you we are fullfulleverywhere
but what passes itself
demanded m bouc angrily
there is a conference somewhere
it is a party
no monsieur
it is only chance
it just happens that many people have elected to travel tonight
m bouc made a clicking sound of annoyance
at belgrade he said there will be the slip coach from athens
there will also be the bucharestparis coach
but we do not reach belgrade until tomorrow evening
the problem is for tonight
there is no secondclass berth free
there is a secondclass berth monsieurwell thenbut it is a ladys berth
there is already a german woman in the compartmenta ladys maid
la la that is awkward said m bouc
do not distress yourself my friend said poirot
i must travel in an ordinary carriage
not at all
not at all
he turned once more to the conductor
everyone has arrived
it is true said the man that there is one passenger who has not yet arrived
he spoke slowly with hesitation
but speak then
no
7 bertha secondclass
the gentleman has not yet come and it is four minutes to nine
who is it
an englishman the conductor consulted his list
a m
harris
a name of good omen said poirot
i read my dickens
m harris he will not arrive
put monsieurs luggage in no
7 said m bouc
if this m harris arrives we will tell him that he is too latethat berths cannot be retained so longwe will arrange the matter one way or another
what do i care for a m
harris
as monsieur pleases said the conductor
he spoke to poirots porter directing him where to go
then he stood aside from the steps to let poirot enter the train
tout a fait au bout monsieur he called
the end compartment but one
poirot passed along the corridor a somewhat slow progress since most of the people travelling were standing outside their carriages
his polite pardons were uttered with the regularity of clockwork
at last he reached the compartment indicated
inside it reaching up to a suitcase was the tall young american of the tokatlian
he frowned as poirot entered
excuse me he said
i think youve made a mistake
then laboriously in french je crois qua vous avez un erreur
poirot replied in english
you are mr
harris
no my name is macqueen
ibut at that moment the voice of the wagon lit conductor spoke from over poirots shoulderan apologetic rather breathless voice
there is no other berth on the train monsieur
the gentleman has to come in here
he was hauling up the corridor window as he spoke and began to lift in poirots luggage
poirot noticed the apology in his tone with some amusement
doubtless the man had been promised a good tip if he could keep the compartment for the sole use of the other traveller
however even the most munificent of tips lose their effect when a director of the company is on board and issues his orders
the conductor emerged from the compartment having swung the suitcases up onto the racks
voila monsieur he said
all is arranged
yours is the upper berth the no
7
we start in one minute
he hurried off down the corridor
poirot reentered the compartment
a phenomenon i have seldom seen he said cheerfully
a wagon lit conductor himself puts up the luggage
it is unheard of
his fellow traveller smiled
he had evidently got over his annoyancehad probably decided that it was no good to take the matter otherwise than philosophically
the trains remarkably full he said
a whistle blew there was a long melancholy cry from the engine
both men stepped out into the corridor
outside a voice shouted en voiture
were off said macqueen
but they were not quite off
the whistle blew again
i say sir said the young man suddenly
if youd rather have the lower bertheasier and all thatwell thats all right by me
a likeable young fellow
no no protested poirot
i would not deprive youthats all rightyou are too amiablepolite protests on both sides
it is for one night only explained poirot
at belgradeoh
i see
youre getting out at belgradenot exactly
you seethere was a sudden jerk
both men swung round to the window looking out at the long lighted platform as it slid slowly past them
the orient express had started on its threeday journey across europe
3poirot refuses a casem hercule poirot was a little late in entering the luncheoncar on the following day
he had risen early had breakfasted almost alone and had spent the morning going over the notes of the case that was recalling him to london
he had seen little of his travelling companion
m bouc who was already seated gated a greeting and summoned his friend to the empty place opposite him
poirot sat down and soon found himself in the favoured position of being at the table which was served first and with the choicest morsels
the food too was unusually good
it was not till they were eating a delicate cream cheese that m bouc allowed his attention to wander to matters other than nourishment
he was at the stage of a meal when one becomes philosophic
ah
he sighed
if i had but the pen of a balzac
i would depict this scene
he waved a hand
it is an idea that said poirot
ah you agree
it has not been done i think
and yetit lends itself to romance my friend
all around us are people of all classes of all nationalities of all ages
for three days these people these strangers to one another are brought together
they sleep and eat under one roof they cannot get away from each other
at the end of three days they part they go their several ways never perhaps to see each other again
and yet said poirot suppose an accidentah no my friendfrom your point of view it would be regrettable i agree
but nevertheless let us just for one moment suppose it
then perhaps all these here are linked togetherby death
some more wine said m bouc hastily pouring it out
you are morbid mon cher
it is perhaps the digestion
it is true agreed poirot that the food in syria was not perhaps quite suited to my stomach
he sipped his wine
then leaning back he ran his eye thoughtfully round the diningcar
there were thirteen people seated there and as m bouc had said of all classes and nationalities
he began to study them
at the table opposite them were three men
they were he guessed single travellers graded and placed there by the unerring judgment of the restaurant attendants
a big swarthy italian was picking his teeth with gusto
opposite him a spare neat englishman had the expressionless disapproving face of the welltrained servant
next to the englishman was a big american in a loud suitpossibly a commercial traveller
youve got to put it over big he was saying in a loud nasal voice
the italian removed his toothpick to gesticulate with it freely
sure he said
that whatta i say alla de time
the englishman looked out of the window and coughed
poirots eye passed on
at a small table sitting very upright was one of the ugliest old ladies he had ever seen
it was an ugliness of distinctionit fascinated rather than repelled
she sat very upright
round her neck was a collar of very large pearls which improbable though it seemed were real
her hands were covered with rings
her sable coat was pushed back on her shoulders
a very small and expensive black toque was hideously unbecoming to the yellow toadlike face beneath it
she was speaking now to the restaurant attendant in a clear courteous but completely autocratic tone
you will be sufficiently amiable to place in my compartment a bottle of mineral water and a large glass of orange juice
you will arrange that i shall have chicken cooked without sauces for dinner this eveningalso some boiled fish
the attendant replied respectfully that it should be done
she gave a slight gracious nod of the head and rose
her glance caught poirots and swept over him with the nonchalance of the uninterested aristocrat
that is princess dragomiroff said m bouc in a low tone
she is a russian
her husband realised all his money before the revolution and invested it abroad
she is extremely rich
a cosmopolitan
poirot nodded
he had heard of princess dragomiroff
she is a personality said m bouc
ugly as sin but she makes herself felt
you agree
poirot agreed
at another of the large tables mary debenham was sitting with two other women
one of them was tall and middleaged in a plaid blouse and tweed skirt
she had a mass of faded yellow hair unbecomingly arranged in a large bun wore glasses and had a long mild amiable face rather like a sheep
she was listening to the third woman a stout pleasantfaced elderly person who was talking in a slow clear monotone which showed no signs of pausing for breath or coming to a stop
and so my daughter said why she said you just cant apply american methods in this country
its natural to the folks here to be indolent she said
they just havent got any hustle in them but all the same youd be surprised to know what our college there is doing
theyve got a fine staff of teachers
i guess theres nothing like education
weve got to apply our western ideals and teach the east to recognise them
my daughter saysthe train plunged into a tunnel
the calm monotonous voice was drowned
at the next table a small one sat colonel arbuthnotalone
his gaze was fixed upon the back of mary debenhams head
they were not sitting together
yet it could easily have been managed
why
perhaps poirot thought mary debenham had demurred
a governess learns to be careful
appearances are important
a girl with her living to get has to be discreet
his glance shifted to the other side of the carriage
at the far end against the wall was a middleaged woman dressed in black with a broad expressionless face
german or scandinavian he thought
probably the german ladysmaid
beyond her were a couple leaning forward and talking animatedly together
the man wore english clothes of loose tweed but he was not english
though only the back of his head was visible to poirot the shape of it and the set of the shoulders betrayed him
a big man well made
he turned his head suddenly and poirot saw his profile
a very handsome man of thirtyodd with a big fair moustache
the woman opposite him was a mere girltwenty at a guess
a tightfitting little black coat and skirt white satin blouse small chic black toque perched at the fashionable outrageous angle
she had a beautiful foreignlooking face dead white skin large brown eyes jet black hair
she was smoking a cigarette in a long holder
her manicured hands had deep red nails
she wore one large emerald set in platinum
there was coquetry in her glance and voice
elle est jolieet chic murmured poirot
husband and wifeeh
m bouc nodded
hungarian embassy i believe he said
a handsome couple
there were only two more luncherspoirots fellow traveller macqueen and his employer mr ratchett
the latter sat facing poirot and for the second time poirot studied that unprepossessing face noting the false benevolence of the brow and the small cruel eyes
doubtless m bouc saw a change in his friends expression
it is at your wild animal you look
he asked
poirot nodded
as his coffee was brought to him m bouc rose to his feet
having started before poirot he had finished some time ago
i return to my compartment he said
come along presently and converse with me
with pleasure
poirot sipped his coffee and ordered a liqueur
the attendant was passing from table to table with his box of money accepting payment for bills
the elderly american ladys voice rose shrill and plaintive
my daughter said take a book of food tickets and youll have no troubleno trouble at all
now that isnt so
seems they have to have a ten per cent tip and then theres that bottle of mineral waterand a queer sort of water too
they didnt have any evian or vichy which seems queer to me
it isthey musthow do you sayserve the water of the country explained the sheepfaced lady
well it seems queer to me
she looked distastefully at the heap of small change on the table in front of her
look at all this peculiar stuff hes given me
dinars or something
just a lot of rubbish it looks like
my daughter saidmary debenham pushed back her chair and left with a slight bow to the other two
colonel arbuthnot got up and followed her
gathering up her despised money the american woman followed suit followed by the other one like a sheep
the hungarians had already departed
the restaurant car was empty save for poirot and ratchett and macqueen
ratchett spoke to his companion who got up and left the car
then he rose himself but instead of following macqueen he dropped unexpectedly into the seat opposite poirot
can you oblige me with a light
he said
his voice was softfaintly nasal
my name is ratchett
poirot bowed slightly
he slipped his hand into his pocket and produced a matchbox which he handed to the other man who took it but did not strike a light
i think he went on that i have the pleasure of speaking to mr hercule poirot
is that so
poirot bowed again
you have been correctly informed monsieur
the detective was conscious of those strange shrewd eyes summing him up before the other spoke again
in my country he said we come to the point quickly
mr poirot i want you to take on a job for me
hercule poirots eyebrows went up a trifle
my clientele monsieur is limited nowadays
i undertake very few cases
why naturally i understand that
but this mr poirot means big money
he repeated again in his soft persuasive voice big money
hercule poirot was silent a minute or two
then he said what is it you wish me to do for you monsieurerratchett
mr poirot i am a rich mana very rich man
men in that position have enemies
i have an enemy
only one enemy
just what do you mean by that question
asked ratchett sharply
monsieur in my experience when a man is in a position to have as you say enemies then it does not usually resolve itself into one enemy only
ratchett seemed relieved bypoirots answer
he said quicklywhy yes i appreciate that point
enemy or enemiesit doesnt matter
what does matter is my safety
safety
my life has been threatened mr poirot
now im a man who can take pretty good care of himself
from the pocket of his coat his hand brought a small automatic into sight for a moment
he continued grimly
i dont think im the kind of man to be caught napping
but as i look at it i might as well make assurance doubly sure
i fancy youre the man for my money mr poirot
and rememberbig money
poirot looked at him thoughtfully for some minutes
his face was completely expressionless
the other could have had no clue as to what thoughts were passing in that mind
i regret monsieur he said at length that i cannot oblige you
the other looked at him shrewdly
name your figure then he said
poirot shook his head
you do not understand monsieur
i have been very fortunate in my profession
i have made enough money to satisfy both my needs and my caprices
i take now only such cases asinterest me
youve got a pretty good nerve said ratchett
will twenty thousand dollars tempt you
it will not
if youre holding out for more you wont get it
i know what a things worth to me
i also m
ratchett
whats wrong with my proposition
poirot rose
if you will forgive me for being personali do not like your face m ratchett he said
and with that he left the restaurant car
4a cry in the nightthe simplon orient express arrived at belgrade at a quarter to nine that evening
it was not due to depart again until 915 so poirot descended to the platform
he did not however remain there long
the cold was bitter and though the platform itself was protected heavy snow was falling outside
he returned to his compartment
the conductor who was on the platform stamping his feet and waving his arms to keep warm spoke to him
your valises have been moved monsieur
to the compartment no
1 the compartment of m
bouc
but where is monsieur bouc then
he has moved into the coach from athens which has just been put on
poirot went in search of his friend
m bouc waved his protestations aside
it is nothing
it is nothing
it is more convenient like this
you are going through to england so it is better that you should stay in the through coach to calais
me i am very well here
it is most peaceful
this coach is empty save for myself and one little greek doctor
ah
my friend what a night
they say there has not been so much snow for years
let us hope we shall not be held up
i am not too happy about it i can tell you
at 915 punctually the train pulled out of the station and shortly afterwards poirot got up said good night to his friend and made his way along the corridor back into his own coach which was in front next to the diningcar
on this the second day of the journey barriers were breaking down
colonel arbuthnot was standing at the door of his compartment talking to macqueen
when macqueen saw poirot he broke off something he was saying
he looked very much surprised
why he cried i thought youd left us
you said you were getting off at belgrade
you misunderstood me said poirot smiling
i remember now the train started from stamboul just as we were talking about it
but man your baggage
its gone
it has been moved into another compartment that is all
oh
i see
he resumed his conversation with arbuthnot and poirot passed on down the corridor
two doors from his own compartment the elderly american mrs hubbard was standing talking to the sheeplike lady who was a swede
mrs hubbard was pressing a magazine on the other
no do take it my dear she said
ive got plenty of other things to read
my isnt the cold something frightful
she nodded amicably to poirot
you are most kind said the swedish lady
not at all
i hope youll sleep well and that your head will be better in the morning
it is the cold only
i make now myself a cup of tea
have you got some aspirin
are you sure now
ive got plenty
well good night my dear
she turned to poirot conversationally as the other woman departed
poor creature shes a swede
as far as i can make out shes a kind of missionary
a teaching one
a nice creature but doesnt talk much english
she was most interested in what i told her about my daughter
poirot by now knew all about mrs hubbards daughter
everyone on the train who could understand english did
how she and her husband were on the staff of a big american college in smyrna and how this was mrs hubbards first journey to the east and what she thought of the turks and their slipshod ways and the condition of their roads
the door next to them opened and the thin pale manservant stepped out
inside poirot caught a glimpse of mr ratchett sitting up in bed
he saw poirot and his face changed darkening with anger
then the door was shut
mrs hubbard drew poirot a little wide
you know im dead scared of that man
oh
not the valetthe other
his master
master indeed
theres something wrong about that man
my daughter always says im very intuitive
when mamma gets a hunch shes dead right thats what my daughter says
and ive got a hunch about that man
hes next door to me and i dont like it
i put my grips against the communicating door last night
i thought i heard him trying the handle
duo you know i shouldnt be a bit surprised if that man turned out to be a murdererone of these train robbers you read about
i daresay im foolish but there it is
im absolutely scared to death of the man
my daughter said id have an easy journey but somehow i dont feel happy about it
it may be foolish but i feel as if anything might happenanything at all
and how that nice young fellow can bear to be his secretary i cant think
colonel arbuthnot and macqueen were coming towards them down the corridor
come into my carriage macqueen was saying
it isnt made up for the night yet
now what i want to get right about your policy in india is thisthe two men passed and went on down the corridor to macqueens carriage
mrs hubbard said good night to poirot
i guess ill go right to bed and read she said
good night
good night madame
poirot passed into his own compartment which was the next one beyond ratchetts
he undressed and got into bed read for about half an hour and then turned out the light
he awoke some hours later awoke with a start
he knew what it was that had wakened hima loud groan almost a cry somewhere close at hand
at the same moment the ting of a bell sounded sharply
poirot sat up and switched on the light
he noticed that the train was at a standstillpresumably at a station
that cry had startled him
he remembered that it was ratchett who had the next compartment
he got out of bed and opened the door just as the wagon lit conductor came hurrying along the corridor and knocked on ratchetts door
poirot kept his door open a crack and watched
the conductor tapped a second time
a bell rang and a light showed over another door farther down
the conductor glanced over his shoulder
at the same moment a voice from within the next compartment called out ce nest rien
je me suis trompe
bien monsieur
the conductor scurried off again to knock at the door where the light was showing
poirot returned to bed his mind relieved and switched off the light
he glanced at his watch
it was just twentythree minutes to one
5the crimehe found it difficult to go to sleep again at once
for one thing he missed the motion of the train
if it was a station outside it was curiously quiet
by contrast the noises on the train seemed unusually loud
he could hear ratchett moving about next doora click as he pulled down the washbasin the sound of the tap running a splashing noise then another click as the basin shut to again
footsteps passed up the corridor outside the shuffling footsteps of someone in bedroom slippers
hercule poirot lay awake staring at the ceiling
why was the station outside so silent
his throat felt dry
he had forgotten to ask for his usual bottle of mineral water
he looked at his watch again
just after a quarter past one
he would ring for the conductor and ask for some mineral water
his finger went out to the bell but he paused as in the stillness he heard a ting
the man couldnt answer every bell at once
ting
 ting
 ting

it sounded again and again
where was the man
somebody was getting impatient
tiiiing
whoever it was was keeping a finger solidly on the pushbutton
suddenly with a rush his footsteps echoing up the aisle the man came
he knocked at a door not far from poirots own
then came voicesthe conductors deferential apologetic and a womans insistent and voluble
mrs hubbard
poirot smiled to himself
the altercationif it was onewent on for some time
its proportions were ninety per cent of mrs hubbards to a soothing ten per cent of the conductors
finally the matter seemed to be adjusted
poirot heard distinctly a bonne nuit madame and a closing door
he pressed his own finger on the bell
the conductor arrived promptly
he looked hot and worried
de leau minerale sil vous plait
bien monsieur
perhaps a twinkle in poirots eye led him to unburden himself
la dame americaineyes
he wiped his forehead
imagine to yourself the time i have had with her
she insistsbut insiststhat there is a man in her compartment
figure to yourself monsieur
in a space of this size
he swept a hand round
where would he conceal himself
i argue with her
i point out that it is impossible
she insists
she woke up and there was a man there
and how i ask did he get out and leave the door bolted behind him
but she will not listen to reason
as though there were not enough to worry us already
this snowsnow
but yes monsieur
monsieur has not noticed
the train has stopped
we have run into a snowdrift
heaven knows how long we shall be here
i remember once being snowed up for seven days
where are we
between vincovci and brod
lala said poirot vexedly
the man withdrew and returned with the water
bon soir monsieur
poirot drank a glass of water and composed himself to sleep
he was just dropping off when something again woke him
this time it was as though something heavy had fallen with a thud against the door
he sprang up opened it and looked out
nothing
but to his right some distance down the corridor a woman wrapped in a scarlet kimono was retreating from him
at the other end sitting on his little seat the conductor was entering up figures on large sheets of paper
everything was deathly quiet
decidedly i suffer from the nerves said poirot and retired to bed again
this time he slept till morning
when he awoke the train was still at a standstill
he raised a blind and looked out
heavy banks of snow surrounded the train
he glanced at his watch and saw that it was past nine oclock
at a quarter to ten neat spruce and dandified as ever he made his way to the restaurant car where a chorus of woe was going on
any barriers there might have been between the passengers had now quite broken down
all were united by a common misfortune
mrs hubbard was loudest in her lamentations
my daughter said it would be the easiest way in the world
just sit in the train until i got to parrus
and now we may be here for days and days she wailed
and my boat sails day after tomorrow
how am i going to catch it now
why i cant even wire to cancel my passage
im just too mad to talk about it
the italian said that he had urgent business himself in milan
the large american said that that was too bad maam and soothingly expressed a hope that the train might make up time
my sisterher children wait me said the swedish lady and wept
i get no word to them
what they think
they will say bad things have happen to me
how long shall we be here
demanded mary debenham
doesnt anybody know
her voice sounded impatient but poirot noted that there were no signs of that almost feverish anxiety which she had displayed during the check to the taurus express
mrs hubbard was off again
there isnt anybody knows a thing on this train
and nobodys trying to do anything
just a pack of useless foreigners
why if this were at home thered be someone at least trying to do something
arbuthnot turned to poirot and spoke in careful british french
vous etes un directeur de la ligne je crois monsieur
vous pouvez nous diresmiling poirot corrected him
no no he said in english
it is not i
you confound me with my friend m
bouc
oh im sorrynot at all
it is most natural
i am now in the compartment that he had formerly
m bouc was not present in the restaurant car
poirot looked about to notice who else was absent
princess dragomiroff was missing and the hungarian couple
also ratchett his valet and the german ladysmaid
the swedish lady wiped her eyes
i am foolish she said
i am bad to cry
all is for the best whatever happen
this christian spirit however was far from being shared
thats all very well said macqueen restlessly
we may be here for days
what is this country anyway
demanded mrs hubbard tearfully
on being told it was jugoslavia she said oh
one of these balkan things
what can you expect
you are the only patient one mademoiselle said poirot to miss debenham
she shrugged her shoulders slightly
what can one do
you are a philosopher mademoiselle
that implies a detached attitude
i think my attitude is more selfish
i have learned to save myself useless emotion
she was speaking more to herself than to him
she was not even looking at him
her gaze went past him out of the window to where the snow lay in heavy masses
you are a strong character mademoiselle said poirot gently
you are i think the strongest character amongst us
oh
no
no indeed
i know one far far stronger than i am
and that is
she seemed suddenly to come to herself to realise that she was talking to a stranger and foreigner with whom until this morning she had exchanged only half a dozen sentences
she laughed a polite but estranging laugh
wellthat old lady for instance
you have probably noticed her
a very ugly old lady but rather fascinating
she has only to lift a little finger and ask for something in a polite voiceand the whole train runs
it runs also for my friend m bouc said poirot
but that is because he is a director of the line not because he has a strong character
mary debenham smiled
the morning wore away
several people poirot amongst them remained in the diningcar
the communal life was felt at the moment to pass the time better
he heard a good deal more about mrs hubbards daughter and he heard the lifelong habits of mr hubbard deceased from his rising in the morning and commencing breakfast with a cereal to his final rest at night in the bedsocks that mrs hubbard herself had been in the habit of knitting for him
it was when he was listening to a confused account of the missionary aims of the swedish lady that one of the wagon lit conductors came into the car and stood at his elbow
pardon monsieur
yes
the compliments of m bouc and he would be glad if you would be so kind as to come to him for a few minutes
poirot rose uttered excuses to the swedish lady and followed the man out of the diningcar
it was not his own conductor but a big fair man
he followed his guide down the corridor of his own carriage and along the corridor of the next one
the man tapped at a door then stood aside to let poirot enter
the compartment was not m boucs own
it was a secondclass onechosen presumably because of its slightly larger size
it certainly gave the impression of being crowded
m bouc himself was sitting on the small seat in the opposite corner
in the corner next the window facing him was a small dark man looking out at the snow
standing up and quite preventing poirot from advancing any farther were a big man in blue uniform the chef de train and his own wagon lit conductor
ah
my good friend cried m bouc
come in
we have need of you
the little man in the window shifted along the seat and poirot squeezed past the other two men and sat down facing his friend
the expression on m boucs face gave him as he would have expressed it furiously to think
it was clear that something out of the common had happened
what has occurred
he asked
you may well ask that
first this snowthis stoppage
and nowhe pausedand a sort of strangled gasp came from the wagon lit conductor
and now what
and now a passenger lies dead in his berthstabbed
m bouc spoke with a kind of calm desperation
a passenger
which passenger
an american
a man calledcalled he consulted some notes in front of him
ratchett
that is rightratchett
yes monsieur the wagon lit man gulped
poirot looked at him
he was as white as chalk
you had better let that man sit down he said
he may faint otherwise
the chef de train moved slightly and the wagon lit man sank down in the corner and buried his face in his hands
brr
said poirot
this is serious
certainly it is serious
to begin with a murderthat in itself is a calamity of the first water
but not only that the circumstances are unusual
here we are brought to a standstill
we may be here for hoursand not only hoursdays
another circumstancepassing through most countries we have the police of that country on the train
but in jugoslavia no
you comprehend
it is a position of great difficulty said poirot
there is worse to come
dr constantinei forgot i have not introduced you
dr constantine m
poirot
the little dark man bowed and poirot returned the bow
dr constantine is of the opinion that death occurred at about 1 amit is difficult to speak exactly in these matters said the doctor but i think i can say definitely that death occurred between midnight and two in the morning
when was this m ratchett last seen alive
asked poirot
he is known to have been alive at about twenty minutes to one when he spoke to the conductor said m bouc
that is quite correct said poirot
i myself heard what passed
that is the last thing known
yes
poirot turned toward the doctor who continued
the window of m ratchetts compartment was found wide open leading one to suppose that the murderer escaped that way
but in my opinion that open window is a blind
anyone departing that way would have left distinct traces in the snow
there were none
the crime was discoveredwhen
asked poirot
michel
the wagon lit conductor sat up
his face still looked pale and frightened
tell this gentleman exactly what occurred ordered m bouc
the man spoke somewhat jerkily
the valet of this m ratchett he tapped several times at the door this morning
there was no answer
then half an hour ago the restaurant car attendant came
he wanted to know if monsieur was taking dejeuner
it was eleven oclock you comprehend
i open the door for him with my key
but there is a chain too and that is fastened
there is no answer and it is very still in there and coldbut cold
with the window open and snow drifting in
i thought the gentleman had had a fit perhaps
i got the chef de train
we broke the chain and went in
he wasah
cetait terrible
he buried his face in his hands again
the door was locked and chained on the inside said poirot thoughtfully
it was not suicideeh
the greek doctor gave a sardonic laugh
does a man who commits suicide stab himself in tentwelvefifteen places
he asked
poirots eyes opened
that is great ferocity he said
it is a woman said the chef de train speaking for the first time
depend upon it it was a woman
only a woman would stab like that
dr constantine screwed up his face thoughtfully
she must have been a very strong woman he said
it is not my desire to speak technicallythat is only confusing but i can assure you that one or two of the blows were delivered with such force as to drive them through hard belts of bone and muscle
it was clearly not a scientific crime said poirot
it was most unscientific returned dr constantine
the blows seem to have been delivered haphazard and at random
some have glanced off doing hardly any damage
it is as though somebody had shut his eyes and then in a frenzy struck blindly again and again
cest une femme said the chef de train again
women are like that
when they are enraged they have great strength
he nodded so sagely that everyone suspected a personal experience of his own
i have perhaps something to contribute to your store of knowledge said poirot
m ratchett spoke to me yesterday
he told me as far as i was able to understand him that he was in danger of his life
 bumped offthat is the american expression is it not
asked m bouc
then it is not a woman
it is a gangster or a gunman
the chef de train looked pained at seeing his theory come to nought
if so said poirot it seems to have been done very amateurishly
his tone expressed professional disapproval
there is a large american on the train
said m bouc pursuing his idea
a commonlooking man with terrible clothes
he chews the gum which i believe is not done in good circles
you know whom i mean
the wagon lit conductor to whom he had appealed nodded
oui monsieur the no
16
but it cannot have been he
i should have seen him enter or leave the compartment
you might not
you might not
but we will go into that presently
the question is what to do
he looked at poirot
poirot looked back at him
come my friend said m bouc
you comprehend what i am about to ask of you
i know your powers
take command of this investigation
no no do not refuse
see to us it is seriousi speak for the compagnie internationale des wagons lits
by the time the jugoslavian police arrive how simple if we can present them with the solution
otherwise delays annoyances a million and one inconveniences
perhaps who knows serious annoyance to innocent persons
insteadyou solve the mystery
we say a murder has occurredthis is the criminal
and suppose i do not solve it
ah mon cher
m boucs voice became positively caressing
i know your reputation
i know something of your methods
this is the ideal case for you
to look up the antecedents of all these people to discover their bona fidesall that takes time and endless inconvenience
but have i not heard you say often that to solve a case a man has only to lie back in his chair and think
do that
interview the passengers on the train view the body examine what clues there are and thenwell i have faith in you
i am assured that it is no idle boast of yours
lie back and thinkuse as i have heard you say so often the little grey cells of the mindand you will know
he leaned forward looking affectionately at the detective
your faith touches me my friend said poirot emotionally
as you say this cannot be a difficult case
i myself last nightbut we will not speak of that now
in truth this problem intrigues me
i was reflecting not half an hour ago that many hours of boredom lay ahead whilst we are stuck here
and nowa problem lies ready to my hand
you accept then
said m bouc eagerly
cest entendu
you place the matter in my hands
goodwe are all at your service
to begin with i should like a plan of the istanbulcalais coach with a note of the people who occupied the several compartments and i should also like to see their passports and their tickets
michel will get you those
the wagon lit conductor left the compartment
what other passengers are there on the train
asked poirot
in this coach dr constantine and i are the only travellers
in the coach from bucharest is an old gentleman with a lame leg
he is well known to the conductor
beyond that are the ordinary carriages but these do not concern us since they were locked after dinner had been served last night
forward of the istanbulcalais coach there is only the diningcar
then it seems said poirot slowly as though we must look for our murderer in the istanbulcalais coach
he turned to the doctor
that is what you were hinting i think
the greek nodded
at half an hour after midnight we ran into the snowdrift
no one can have left the train since then
m bouc said solemnly the murderer is with uson the train now
6a womanfirst of all said poirot i should like a word or two with young mr macqueen
he may be able to give us valuable information
certainly said m bouc
he turned to the chef de train
get mr macqueen to come here
the chef de train left the carriage
the conductor returned with a bundle of passports and tickets
m bouc took them from him
thank you michel
it would be best now i think if you were to go back to your post
we will take your evidence formally later
very good monsieur said michel and in his turn left the carriage
after we have seen young macqueen said poirot perhaps m le docteur will come with me to the dead mans carriage
certainly
after we have finished therebut at this moment the chef de train returned with hector macqueen
m bouc rose
we are a little cramped here he said pleasantly
take my seat mr macqueen
m poirot will sit opposite youso
he turned to the chef de train
clear all the people out of the restaurant car he said and let it be left free for m poirot
you will conduct your interviews there mon cher
it would be the most convenient yes agreed poirot
macqueen had stood looking from one to the other not quite following the rapid flow of french
questce quil y a
he began laboriously
pourquoi
with a vigorous gesture poirot motioned him to the seat in the corner
he took it and began once more
pourquoi
then checking himself and relapsing into his own tongue whats up on the train
has anything happened
he looked from one man to another
poirot nodded
exactly
something has happened
prepare yourself for a shock
your employer m ratchett is dead
macqueens mouth pursed itself into a whistle
except that his eyes grew a shade brighter he showed no signs of shock or distress
so they got him after all he said
what exactly do you mean by that phrase mr
macqueen
macqueen hesitated
you are assuming said poirot that m ratchett was murdered
wasnt he
this time macqueen did show surprise
why yes he said slowly
thats just what i did think
do you mean he just died in his sleep
why the old man was as tough asas toughhe stopped at a loss for a simile
no no said poirot
your assumption was quite right
m ratchett was murdered
stabbed
but i should like to know why you were so sure it was murder and not justdeath
macqueen hesitated
i must get this clear he said
who exactly are you
and where do you come in
i represent the compagnie internationale des wagons lits
poirot paused then added i am a detective
my name is hercule poirot
if he expected an effect he did not get one
macqueen said merely oh
yes
and waited for him to go on
you know the name perhaps
why it does seem kind of familiar
only i always thought it was a womans dressmaker
hercule poirot looked at him with distaste
it is incredible
he said
whats incredible
nothing
let us advance with the matter in hand
i want you to tell me m macqueen all that you know about the dead man
you were not related to him
no
i amwashis secretary
for how long have you held that post
just over a year
please give me all the information you can
well i met mr ratchett just over a year ago when i was in persiapoirot interrupted
what were you doing there
i had come over from new york to look into an oil concession
i dont suppose you want to hear all about that
my friends and i had been let in rather badly over it
mr ratchett was in the same hotel
he had just had a row with his secretary
he offered me the job and i took it
i was at a loose end and glad to find a wellpaid job ready made as it were
and since then
weve travelled about
mr ratchett wanted to see the world
he was hampered by knowing no languages
i acted more as a courier than as a secretary
it was a pleasant life
now tell me as much as you can about your employer
the young man shrugged his shoulders
a perplexed expression passed over his face
thats not so easy
what was his full name
samuel edward ratchett
he was an american citizen
yes
what part of america did he come from
i dont know
well tell me what you do know
the actual truth is mr poirot that i know nothing at all
mr ratchett never spoke of himself or of his life in america
why do you think that was
i dont know
i imagined that he might be ashamed of his beginnings
some men are
does that strike you as a satisfactory solution
frankly it doesnt
has he any relatives
he never mentioned any
poirot pressed the point
you must have formed some theory mr
macqueen
well yes i did
for one thing i dont believe ratchett was his real name
i think he left america definitely in order to escape someone or something
i think he was successfuluntil a few weeks ago
and then
he began to get lettersthreatening letters
did you see them
yes
it was my business to attend to his correspondence
the first letter came a fortnight ago
were these letters destroyed
no i think ive got a couple still in my filesone i know ratchett tore up in a rage
shall i get them for you
if you would be so good
macqueen left the compartment
he returned a few minutes later and laid down two sheets of rather dirty notepaper before poirot
the first letter ran as followsthought youd doublecross us and get away with it did you
not on your life
were out to get you ratchett and we will get you
there was no signature
with no comment beyond raised eyebrows poirot picked up the second letter
were going to take you for a ride ratchett
some time soon
were going to get yousee
poirot laid the letter down
the style is monotonous
he said
more so than the handwriting
macqueen stared at him
you would not observe said poirot pleasantly
it requires the eye of one used to such things
this letter was not written by one person m macqueen
two or more persons wrote iteach writing one letter of a word at a time
also the letters are printed
that makes the task of identifying the handwriting much more difficult
he paused then said did you know that m ratchett had applied for help to me
to you
macqueens astonished tone told poirot quite certainly that the young man had not known of it
the detective nodded
yes
he was alarmed
tell me how did he act when he received the first letter
macqueen hesitated
its difficult to say
hehepassed it off with a laugh in that quiet way of his
but somehow he gave a slight shiveri felt that there was a good deal going on underneath the quietness
poirot nodded
then he asked an unexpected question
mr macqueen will you tell me quite honestly exactly how you regarded your employer
did you like him
hector macqueen took a moment or two before replying
no he said at last
i did not
why
i cant exactly say
he was always quite pleasant in his manner
he paused then said ill tell you the truth mr poirot
i disliked and distrusted him
he was i am sure a cruel and dangerous man
i must admit though that i have no reasons to advance for my opinion
thank you mr macqueen
one further question when did you last see mr ratchett alive
last evening about he thought for a minuteten oclock i should say
i went into his compartment to take down some memoranda from him
on what subject
some tiles and antique pottery that he bought in persia
what had been delivered was not what he had purchased
there has been a long vexatious correspondence on the subject
and that was the last time mr ratchett was seen alive
yes i suppose so
do you know when mr ratchett received the last threatening letter
on the morning of the day we left constantinople
there is one more question i must ask you mr macqueen
were you on good terms with your employer
the young mans eyes twinkled suddenly
this is where im supposed to go all goosefleshy down the back
in the words of a best seller youve nothing on me
ratchett and i were on perfectly good terms
perhaps mr macqueen you will give me your full name and your address in america
macqueen gave his namehector willard macqueenand an address in new york
poirot leaned back against the cushions
that is all for the present mr macqueen he said
i should be obliged if you would keep the matter of mr ratchetts death to yourself for a little time
his valet masterman will have to know
he probably knows already said poirot drily
if so try to get him to hold his tongue
that oughtnt to be difficult
hes a britisher and as he calls it he keeps to himself
he has a low opinion of americans and no opinion at all of any other nationality
thank you mr
macqueen
the american left the carriage
well
demanded m bouc
you believe what he says this young man
he seems honest and straightforward
he did not pretend to any affection for his employer as he probably would have done had he been involved in any way
it is true mr ratchett did not tell him that he had tried to enlist my services and failed but i do not think that that is really a suspicious circumstance
i fancy mr ratchett was a gentleman who kept his own counsel on every possible occasion
so you pronounce one person at least innocent of the crime said m bouc jovially
poirot cast on him a look of reproach
me i suspect everybody till the last minute he said
all the same i must admit that i cannot see this sober longheaded macqueen losing his head and stabbing his victim twelve or fourteen times
it is not in accord with his psychologynot at all
no said m bouc thoughtfully
that is the act of a man driven almost crazy with a frenzied hateit suggests rather the latin temperament
or else it suggests as our friend the chef de train insisteda woman
7the bodyfollowed by dr constantine poirot made his way to the next coach and to the compartment occupied by the murdered man
the conductor came and unlocked the door for them with his key
the two men passed inside
poirot turned inquiringly to his companion
how much has been disarranged in this compartment
nothing has been touched
i was careful not to move the body in making my examination
poirot nodded
he looked round him
the first thing that struck the senses was the intense cold
the window was pushed down as far as it would go and the blind was drawn up
brrr observed poirot
the other smiled appreciatively
i did not like to close it he said
poirot examined the window carefully
you are right he announced
nobody left the carriage this way
possibly the open window was intended to suggest that somebody did but if so the snow has defeated the murderers intention
he examined the frame of the window carefully
taking a small case from his pocket he blew a little powder over the frame
no fingerprints at all he said
that means it has been wiped
well if there had been fingerprints they would have told us very little
they would have been those of mr ratchett or his valet or the conductor
criminals do not make mistakes of that kind nowadays
and that being so he added cheerfully we might as well shut the window
positively it is the cold storage in here
he suited the action to the word and then turned his attention for the first time to the motionless figure lying in the bunk
ratchett lay on his back
his pyjama jacket stained with rusty patches had been unbuttoned and thrown back
i had to see the nature of the wounds you see explained the doctor
poirot nodded
he bent over the body
finally he straightened himself with a slight grimace
it is not pretty he said
someone must have stood there and stabbed him again and again
how many wounds are there exactly
i make it twelve
one or two are so slight as to be practically scratches
on the other hand at least three would be capable of causing death
something in the doctors tone caught poirots attention
he looked at him sharply
the little greek was standing staring down at the body with a puzzled frown
something strikes you as odd does it not
he asked gently
speak my friend
there is something here that puzzles you
you are right acknowledged the other
what is it
you see these two woundshere and here he pointed
they are deep
each cut must have severed blood vesselsand yet the edges do not gape
they have not bled as one would have expected
which suggests
that the man was already deadsome little time deadwhen they were delivered
but that is surely absurd
it would seem so said poirot thoughtfully
unless our murderer figured to himself that he had not accomplished his job properly and came back to make quite surebut that is manifestly absurd
anything else
well just one thing
and that
you see this wound hereunder the right armnear the right shoulder
take this pencil of mine
could you deliver such a blow
poirot poised his hand
precisement he said
i see
with the right hand it is exceedingly difficult almost impossible
one would have to strike backhanded as it were
but if the blow were struck with the left handexactly m poirot
that blow was almost certainly struck with the left hand
so that our murderer is lefthanded
no it is more difficult than that is it not
as you say m poirot
some of these other blows are just as obviously righthanded
two people
we are back at two people again murmured the detective
he asked abruptly was the electric light on
it is difficult to say
you see it is turned off by the conductor every morning about ten oclock
the switches will tell us said poirot
he examined the switch of the top light and also the rollback bedhead light
the former was turned off
the latter was closed
eh bien he said thoughtfully
we have here a hypothesis of the first and the second murderer as the great shakespeare would put it
the first murderer stabbed his victim and left the compartment turning off the light
the second murderer came in in the dark did not see that his or her work had been done and stabbed at least twice at a dead body
que pensezvous de ca
magnificent
said the little doctor with enthusiasm
the others eyes twinkled
you think so
i am glad
it sounded to me a little like the nonsense
what other explanation can there be
that is just what i am asking myself
have we here a coincidence or what
are there any other inconsistencies such as would point to two people being concerned
i think i can say yes
some of these blows as i have already said point to a weaknessa lack of strength or a lack of determination
they are feeble glancing blows
but this one hereand this one again he pointed
great strength was needed for those blows
they have penetrated the muscle
they were in your opinion delivered by a man
most certainly
they could not have been delivered by a woman
a young vigorous athletic woman might have struck them especially if she were in the grip of a strong emotion but it is in my opinion highly unlikely
poirot was silent a moment or two
the other asked anxiously you understand my point
perfectly said poirot
the matter begins to clear itself up wonderfully
the murderer was a man of great strengthhe was feebleit was a womanit was a righthanded personit was a lefthanded person
ah
cest rigolo tout ca
he spoke with sudden anger
and the victimwhat does he do in all this
does he cry out
does he struggle
does he defend himself
he slipped his hand under the pillow and drew out the automatic pistol which ratchett had shown him the day before
fully loaded you see he said
they looked round them
ratchetts day clothing was hanging from the hooks on the wall
on the small table formed by the lid of the wash basin were various objects
false teeth in a glass of water
another glass empty
a bottle of mineral water
a large flask
an ashtray containing the butt of a cigar and some charred fragments of paper also two burnt matches
the doctor picked up the empty glass and sniffed it
here is the explanation of the victims inertia he said quietly
drugged
yes
poirot nodded
he picked up the two matches and scrutinised them carefully
you have a clue then
demanded the little doctor eagerly
those two matches are of different shapes said poirot
one is flatter than the other
you see
it is the kind you get on the train said the doctor
in paper covers
poirot was feeling in the pockets of ratchetts clothing
presently he pulled out a box of matches
he compared them carefully with the burnt ones
the rounder one is a match struck by mr ratchett he said
let us see if he had also the flatter kind
but a further search showed no other matches
poirots eyes were darting about the compartment
they were bright and sharp like a birds
one felt that nothing could escape their scrutiny
with a little exclamation he bent and pickedup something from the floor
it was a small square of cambric very dainty
in the corner was an embroidered initialha womans handkerchief said the doctor
our friend the chef de train was right
there is a woman concerned in this
and most conveniently she leaves her handkerchief behind
said poirot
exactly as it happens in the books and on the filmsand to make things even easier for us it is marked with an initial
what a stroke of luck for us
exclaimed the doctor
is it not
said poirot
something in his tone surprised the doctor but before he could ask for elucidation poirot had made another dive onto the floor
this time he held out on the palm of his handa pipecleaner
it is perhaps the property of mr
ratchett
suggested the doctor
there was no pipe in any of his pockets and no tobacco or tobacco pouch
then it is a clue
oh
decidedly
and again dropped most conveniently
a masculine clue this time you note
one cannot complain of having no clues in this case
there are clues here in abundance
by the way what have you done with the weapon
there was no sign of any weapon
the murderer must have taken it away with him
i wonder why mused poirot
ah
the doctor had been delicately exploring the pyjama pockets of the dead man
i overlooked this he said
i unbuttoned the jacket and threw it straight back
from the breast pocket he brought out a gold watch
the case was dented savagely and the hands pointed to a quarter past one
you see
cried constantine eagerly
this gives us the hour of the crime
it agrees with my calculations
between midnight and two in the morning is what i said and probably about one oclock though it is difficult to be exact in these matters
eh bien here is confirmation
a quarter past one
that was the hour of the crime
it is possible yes
it is certainly possible
the doctor looked at him curiously
you will pardon me m poirot but i do not quite understand you
i do not understand myself said poirot
i understand nothing at all
and as you perceive it worries me
he sighed and bent over the little table examining the charred fragment of paper
he murmured to himself what i need at this moment is an oldfashioned womans hatbox
dr constantine was at a loss to know what to make of this singular remark
in any case poirot gave him no time for questions
opening the door into the corridor he called for the conductor
the man arrived at a run
how many women are there in this coach
the conductor counted on his fingers
one two threesix monsieur
the old american lady a swedish lady the young english lady the countess andrenyi and madame la princesse dragomiroff and her maid
poirot considered
they all have hatboxes yes
yes monsieur
then bring melet me seeyes the swedish ladys and that of the ladysmaid
those two are the only hope
you will tell them it is a customs regulationsomethinganything that occurs to you
that will be all right monsieur
neither lady is in her compartment at the moment
then be quick
the conductor departed
he returned with the two hatboxes
poirot opened that of the maid and tossed it aside
then he opened the swedish ladys and uttered an exclamation of satisfaction
removing the hats carefully he disclosed round humps of wirenetting
ah here is what we need
about fifteen years ago hatboxes were made like this
you skewered through the hat with a hatpin on to this hump of wirenetting
as he spoke he was skillfully removing two of the attached humps
then he repacked the hatbox and told the conductor to return both boxes where they belonged
when the door was shut once more he turned to his companion
see you my dear doctor me i am not one to rely upon the expert procedure
it is the psychology i seek not the fingerprint or the cigarette ash
but in this case i would welcome a little scientific assistance
this compartment is full of clues but can i be sure that those clues are really what they seem to be
i do not quite understand you m
poirot
well to give you an examplewe find a womans handkerchief
did a woman drop it
or did a man committing the crime say to himself i will make this look like a womans crime
i will stab my enemy an unnecessary number of times making some of the blows feeble and ineffective and i will drop this handkerchief where no one can miss it
that is one possibility
then there is another
did a woman kill him and did she deliberately drop a pipecleaner to make it look like a mans work
or are we seriously to suppose that two people a man and a woman were separately concerned and that each was so careless as to drop a clue to his or her identity
it is a little too much of a coincidence that
but where does the hatbox come in
asked the doctor still puzzled
ah
i am coming to that
as i say these cluesthe watch stopped at a quarter past one the handkerchief the pipecleanerthey may be genuine or they may be faked
as to that i cannot yet tell
but there is one clue here whichthough again i may be wrongi believe has not been faked
i mean this flat match m le docteur
i believe that that match was used by the murderer not by mr ratchett
it was used to burn an incriminating paper of some kind
possibly a note
if so there was something in that note some mistake some error that left a possible clue to the assailant
i am going to try to discover what that something was
he went out of the compartment and returned a few moments later with a small spirit stove and a pair of curlingtongs
i use them for the moustaches he said referring to the latter
the doctor watched him with great interest
poirot flattened out the two humps of wire and with great care wriggled the charred scrap of paper on to one of them
he clapped the other on top of it and then holding both pieces together with the tongs held the whole thing over the flame of the spiritlamp
it is a very makeshift affair this he said over his shoulder
let us hope that it will answer our purpose
the doctor watched the proceedings attentively
the metal began to glow
suddenly he saw faint indications of letters
words formed themselves slowlywords of fire
it was a very tiny scrap
only three words and part of another showed
member little daisy armstrongah
poirot gave a sharp exclamation
it tells you something
asked the doctor
poirots eyes were shining
he laid down the tongs carefully
yes he said
i know the dead mans real name
i know why he had to leave america
what was his name
cassetti
cassetti
constantine knitted his brows
it brings back to me something
some years ago
i cannot remember

it was a case in america was it not
yes said poirot
a case in america
further than that poirot was not disposed to be communicative
he looked round him as he went onwe will go into all that presently
let us first make sure that we have seen all there is to be seen here
quickly and deftly he went once more through the pockets of the dead mans clothes but found nothing there of interest
he tried the communicating door which led through to the next compartment but it was bolted on the other side
there is one thing that i do not understand said dr constantine
if the murderer did not escape through the window and if this communicating door was bolted on the other side and if the door into the corridor was not only locked on the inside but chained how then did the murderer leave the compartment
that is what the audience says when a person bound hand and foot is shut into a cabinetand disappears
you mean
i mean explained poirot that if the murderer intended us to believe that he had escaped by way of the window he would naturally make it appear that the other two exits were impossible
like the disappearing person in the cabinet it is a trick
it is our business to find out how the trick is done
he locked the communicating door on their sidein case he said the excellent mrs hubbard should take it into her head to acquire firsthand details of the crime to write to her daughter
he looked round once more
there is nothing more to do here i think
let us rejoin m
bouc
8the armstrong kidnapping casethey found m bouc finishing an omelet
i thought it best to have lunch served immediately in the restaurant car he said
afterwards it will be cleared and m poirot can conduct his examination of the passengers there
in the meantime i have ordered them to bring us three some food here
an excellent idea said poirot
none of the three men was hungry and the meal was soon eaten but not till they were sipping their coffee did m bouc mention the subject that was occupying all their minds
eh bien
he asked
eh bien i have discovered the identity of the victim
i know why it was imperative he should leave america
who was he
do you remember reading of the armstrong baby
this is the man who murdered little daisy armstrong
cassetti
i recall it now
a shocking affairthough i cannot remember the details
colonel armstrong was an englishmana vc
he was half american his mother having been a daughter of w k van der halt the wall street millionaire
he married the daughter of linda arden the most famous tragic american actress of her day
they lived in america and had one childa girl whom they idolized
when she was three years old she was kidnapped and an impossibly high sum demanded as the price of her return
i will not weary you with all the intricacies that followed
i will come to the moment when after the parents had paid over the enormous sum of two hundred thousand dollars the childs dead body was discovered it had been dead for at least a fortnight
public indignation rose to fever point
and there was worse to follow
mrs armstrong was expecting another baby
following the shock of the discovery she gave birth prematurely to a dead child and herself died
her brokenhearted husband shot himself
mon dieu what a tragedy
i remember now said m bouc
there was also another death if i remember rightly
yes an unfortunate french or swiss nursemaid
the police were convinced that she had some knowledge of the crime
they refused to believe her hysterical denials
finally in a fit of despair the poor girl threw herself from a window and was killed
it was proved afterwards that she had been absolutely innocent of any complicity in the crime
it is not good to think of said m bouc
about six months later this man cassetti was arrested as the head of the gang who had kidnapped the child
they had used the same methods in the past
if the police seemed likely to get on their trail they killed their prisoner hid the body and continued to extract as much money as possible before the crime was discovered
now i will make clear to you this my friend
cassetti was the man
but by means of the enormous wealth he had piled up and owing to the secret hold he had over various persons he was acquitted on some technical inaccuracy
notwithstanding that he would have been lynched by the populace had he not been clever enough to give them the slip
it is now clear to me what happened
he changed his name and left america
since then he has been a gentleman of leisure travelling abroad and living on his rentes
ah
quel animal
m boucs tone was redolent of heartfelt disgust
i cannot regret that he is deadnot at all
i agree with you
tout de meme it is not necessary that he should be killed on the orient express
there are other places
poirot smiled a little
he realised that m bouc was biased in the matter
the question we have now to ask ourselves is this he said
is this murder the work of some rival gang whom cassetti had doublecrossed in the past or is it an act of private vengeance
he explained his discovery of the few words on the charred fragment of paper
if i am right in my assumption then the letter was burnt by the murderer
why
because it mentioned the name armstrong which is the clue to the mystery
are there any members of the armstrong family living
that unfortunately i do not know
i think i remember reading of a younger sister of mrs
armstrongs
poirot went on to relate the joint conclusions of himself and dr constantine
m bouc brightened at the mention of the broken watch
that seems to give us the time of the crime very exactly
yes said poirot
it is very convenient
there was an indescribable something in his tone that made both the other two look at him curiously
you say that you yourself heard ratchett speak to the conductor at twenty minutes to one
asked m bouc
poirot related just what had occurred
well said m bouc that proves at least that cassettior ratchett as i shall continue to call himwas certainly alive at twenty minutes to one
twentythree minutes to one to be precise
then at twelve thirtyseven to put it formally mr ratchett was alive
that is one fact at least
poirot did not reply
he sat looking thoughtfully in front of him
there was a tap on the door and the restaurant attendant entered
the restaurant car is free now monsieur he said
we will go there said m bouc rising
i may accompany you
asked constantine
certainly my dear doctor
unless m poirot has any objection
not at all
not at all said poirot
after a little politeness in the matter of precedenceapres vous monsieurmais non apres vousthey left the compartment
part iithe evidence1the evidence of the wagon lit conductorin the restaurant car all was in readiness
poirot and m bouc sat together on one side of a table
the doctor sat across the aisle
on the table in front of poirot was a plan of the istanbulcalais coach with the names of the passengers marked in red ink
the passports and tickets were in a pile at one side
there was writing paper ink pen and pencils
excellent said poirot
we can open our court of inquiry without more ado
first i think we should take the evidence of the wagon lit conductor
you probably know something about the man
what character has he
is he a man on whose word you would place reliance
i should say so most assuredly
pierre michel has been employed by the company for over fifteen years
he is a frenchmanlives near calais
thoroughly respectable and honest
not perhaps remarkable for brains
poirot nodded comprehendingly
good he said
let us see him
pierre michel had recovered some of his assurance but he was still extremely nervous
i hope monsieur will not think that there has been any negligence on my part he said anxiously his eyes going from poirot to m bouc
it is a terrible thing that has happened
i hope monsieur does not think that it reflects on me in any way
having soothed the mans fears poirot began his questions
he first elicited michels name and address his length of service and the length of time he had been on this particular route
these particulars he already knew but the routine questions served to put the man at his ease
and now went on poirot let us come to the events of last night
m ratchett retired to bedwhen
almost immediately after dinner monsieur
actually before we left belgrade
so he did on the previous night
he had directed me to make up the bed while he was at dinner and i did so
did anybody go into his compartment afterwards
his valet monsieur and the young american gentleman his secretary
anyone else
no monsieur not that i know of
good
and that is the last you saw or heard of him
no monsieur
you forget he rang his bell about twenty to onesoon after we had stopped
what happened exactly
i knocked at the door but he called out and said he had made a mistake
in english or in french
in french
what were his words exactly
ce nest rien
je me suis trompe
quite right said poirot
that is what i heard
and then you went away
yes monsieur
did you go back to your seat
no monsieur i went first to answer another bell that had just rung
now michel i am going to ask you an important question
where were you at a quarter past one
i monsieur
i was at my little seat at the endfacing up the corridor
you are sure
mais ouiat leasti went into the next coach the athens coach to speak to my colleague there
we spoke about the snow
that was at some time soon after one oclock
i cannot say exactly
and you returnedwhen
one of my bells rang monsieuri rememberi told you
it was the american lady
she had rung several times
i recollect said poirot
and after that
after that monsieur
i answered your bell and brought you some mineral water
then about half an hour later i made up the bed in one of the other compartmentsthat of the young american gentleman mr ratchetts secretary
was mr macqueen alone in his compartment when you went to make up his bed
the english colonel from no
15 was with him
they had been sitting talking
what did the colonel do when he left mr
macqueen
he went back to his own compartment
no
15that is quite close to your seat is it not
yes monsieur it is the second compartment from that end of the corridor
his bed was already made up
yes monsieur
i had made it up while he was at dinner
what time was all this
i could not say exactly monsieur
not later than two oclock certainly
and after that
after that monsieur i sat in my seat till morning
you did not go again into the athens coach
no monsieur
perhaps you slept
i do not think so monsieur
the train being at a standstill prevented me from dozing off as i usually do
did you see any of the passengers moving up or down the corridor
the man reflected
one of the ladies went to the toilet at the far end i think
which lady
i do not know monsieur
it was far down the corridor and she had her back to me
she had on a kimono of scarlet with dragons on it
poirot nodded
and after that
nothing monsieur until the morning
you are sure
ah pardonyou yourself monsieur opened your door and looked out for a second
good my friend said poirot
i wondered whether you would remember that
by the way i was awakened by what sounded like something heavy falling against my door
have you any idea what that could have been
the man stared at him
there was nothing monsieur
nothing i am positive of it
then i must have had the cauchemar said poirot philosophically
unless put in m bouc it was something in the compartment next door that you heard
poirot took no notice of the suggestion
perhaps he did not wish to before the wagon lit conductor
let us pass to another point he said
supposing that last night an assassin joined the train
is it quite certain that he could not have left it after committing the crime
pierre michel shook his head
nor that he can be concealed on it somewhere
it has been well searched said m bouc
abandon that idea my friend
besides said michel no one could get on to the sleepingcar without my seeing them
when was the last stop
vincovci
what time was that
we should have left there at 1158 but owing to the weather we were twenty minutes late
someone might have come along from the ordinary part of the train
no monsieur
after the service of dinner the door between the ordinary carriages and the sleepingcars is locked
did you yourself descend from the train at vincovci
yes monsieur
i got down onto the platform as usual and stood by the step up into the train
the other conductors did the same
what about the forward doorthe one near the restaurant car
it is always fastened on the inside
it is not so fastened now
the man looked surprised then his face cleared
doubtless one of the passengers opened it to look out on the snow
probably said poirot
he tapped thoughtfully on the table for a minute or two
monsieur does not blame me
said the man timidly
poirot smiled on him kindly
you have had the evil chance my friend he said
ah
one other point while i remember it
you said that another bell rang just as you were knocking at m ratchetts door
in fact i heard it myself whose was it
it was the bell of madame la princesse dragomiroff
she desired me to summon her maid
and you did so
yes monsieur
poirot studied the plan in front of him thoughtfully
then he inclined his head
that is all he said for the moment
thank you monsieur
the man rose
he looked at m bouc
do not distress yourself said the latter kindly i cannot see that there has been any negligence on your part
gratified pierre michel left the compartment
2the evidence of the secretaryfor a minute or two poirot remained lost in thought
i think he said at last that it would be well to have a further word with mr macqueen in view of what we now know
the young american appeared promptly
well he said how are things going
not too badly
since our last conversation i have learnt somethingthe identity of mr
ratchett
hector macqueen leaned forward interestedly
yes
he said
ratchett as you suspected was merely an alias
the man ratchett was cassetti who ran the celebrated kidnapping stuntsincluding the famous affair of little daisy armstrong
an expression of utter astonishment appeared on macqueens face
then it darkened
the damned skunk
he exclaimed
you had no idea of this mr
macqueen
no sir said the young american decidedly
if i had id have cut off my right hand before it had a chance to do secretarial work for him
you feel strongly about the matter mr
macqueen
i have a particular reason for doing so
my father was the district attorney who handled the case mr poirot
i saw mrs armstrong more than onceshe was a lovely woman
so gentle and heartbroken
his face darkened
if ever a man deserved what he got ratchettor cassettiis the man
im rejoiced at his end
such a man wasnt fit to live
you almost feel as though you would have been willing to do the good deed yourself
i do
i he paused then added rather guiltily seems im kind of incriminating myself
i should be more inclined to suspect you mr macqueen if you displayed an inordinate sorrow at your employers decease
i dont think i could do that even to save myself from the chair said macqueen grimly
then he added if im not being unduly curious just how did you figure this out
cassettis identity i mean
by a fragment of a letter found in his compartment
but surelyi meanthat was rather careless of the old man
that depends said poirot on the point of view
the young man seemed to find this remark rather baffling
he stared at poirot as though trying to make him out
the task before me said poirot is to make sure of the movements of every one on the train
no offence need be taken you understand
it is only a matter of routine
sure
get right on with it and let me clear my character if i can
i need hardly ask you the number of your compartment said poirot smiling since i shared it with you for a night
it is the secondclass compartment nos
6 and 7 and after my departure you had it to yourself
thats right
now mr macqueen i want you to describe your movements last night from the time of leaving the diningcar
thats quite easy
i went back to my compartment read a bit got out on the platform at belgrade decided it was too cold and got in again
i talked for a while to a young english lady who is in the compartment next to mine
then i fell into conversation with that englishman colonel arbuthnotas a matter of fact i think you passed us as we were talking
then i went in to mr ratchett and as i told you took down some memoranda of letters he wanted written
i said good tight to him and left him
colonel arbuthnot was still standing in the corridor
his compartment was already made up for the night so i suggested that he should come along to mine
i ordered a couple of drinks and we got right down to it
discussed world politics and the government of india and our own troubles with prohibition and the wall street crisis
i dont as a rule cotton to britisherstheyre a stiffnecked lotbut i liked this one
do you know what time it was when he left you
pretty late
nearly two oclock i should say
you noticed that the train had stopped
oh yes
we wondered a bit
looked out and saw the snow lying very thick but we didnt think it was serious
what happened when colonel arbuthnot finally said good night
he went along to his compartment and i called to the conductor to make up my bed
where were you whilst he was making it
standing just outside the door in the corridor smoking a cigarette
and then
and then i went to bed and slept till morning
during the evening did you leave the train at all
arbuthnot and i thought wed get out atwhat was the name of the placevincovcito stretch our legs a bit
but it was bitterly colda blizzard on
we soon hopped back again
by which door did you leave the train
by the one nearest to our compartment
the one next to the diningcar
yes
do you remember if it was bolted
macqueen considered
why yes i seem to remember it was
at least there was a kind of bar that fitted across the handle
is that what you mean
yes
on getting back into the train did you replace that bar
why noi dont think i did
i got in last
no i dont seem to remember doing so
he added suddenly is that an important point
it may be
now i presume monsieur that while you and colonel arbuthnot were sitting talking the door of your compartment into the corridor was open
hector macqueen nodded
i want you if you can to tell me if anyone passed along that corridor after the train left vincovci up to the time you parted company for the night
macqueen drew his brows together
i think the conductor passed along once he said coming from the direction of the diningcar
and a woman passed the other way going towards it
which woman
i couldnt say
i didnt really notice
you see i was arguing a point with arbuthnot
i just seem to remember a glimpse of some scarlet silk affair passing the door
i didnt look and anyway i wouldnt have seen the persons face
as you know my carriage faces the diningcar end of the train so a woman going along the corridor in that direction would have her back to me as soon as shed passed
poirot nodded
she was going to the toilet i presume
i suppose so
and you saw her return
well no now that you mention it i didnt notice her returning but i suppose she must have done so
one more question
do you smoke a pipe mr
macqueen
no sir i do not
poirot paused a moment
i think that is all at present
i should now like to see the valet of mr ratchett
by the way did both you and he always travel secondclass
he did
but i usually went firstif possible in the compartment adjoining mr ratchetts
then he had most of his baggage put in my compartment and yet could get at both it and me easily whenever he chose
but on this occasion all the firstclass berths were booked except the one that he took
i comprehend
thank you mr
macqueen
3the evidence of the valetthe american was succeeded by the pale englishman with the inexpressive face whom poirot had already noticed on the day before
he stood waiting very correctly
poirot motioned to him to sit down
you are i understand the valet of m
ratchett
yes sir
your name
edward henry masterman
your age
thirtynine
and your home address
21 friar street clerkenwell
you have heard that your master has been murdered
yes sir
a very shocking occurrence
will you now tell me please at what hour you last saw m
ratchett
the valet considered
it must have been about nine oclock sir last night
that or a little after
tell me in your own words exactly what happened
i went in to mr ratchett as usual sir and attended to his wants
what were your duties exactly
to fold or hang up his clothes sir put his dental plate in water and see that he had everything he wanted for the night
was his manner much the same as usual
the valet considered a moment
well sir i think he was upset
in what wayupset
over a letter hed been reading
he asked me if it was i who had put it in his compartment
of course i told him i hadnt done any such thing but he swore at me and found fault with everything i did
was that unusual
oh no sir
he lost his temper easilyas i say it just depended what had happened to upset him
did your master ever take a sleeping draught
dr constantine leaned forward a little
always when travelling by train sir
he said he couldnt sleep otherwise
do you know what drug he was in the habit of taking
i couldnt say im sure sir
there was no name on the bottlejust the sleeping draught to be taken at bedtime
did he take it last night
yes sir
i poured it into a glass and put it on top of the toilet table ready for him
you didnt actually see him drink it
no sir
what happened next
i asked if there was anything further and also asked what time he would like to be called in the morning
he said he didnt want to be disturbed till he rang
was that usual
quite usual sir
when he was ready to get up he used to ring the bell for the conductor and then send him for me
was he usually an early or a late riser
it depended sir on his mood
sometimes hed get up for breakfast sometimes he wouldnt get up till just on lunch time
so that you werent alarmed when the morning wore on and no summons came
no sir
did you know that your master had enemies
yes sir
the man spoke quite unemotionally
how did you know
i had heard him discussing some letters sir with mr
macqueen
had you an affection for your employer masterman
mastermans face became if possible even more inexpressive than it was normally
i should hardly like to say that sir
he was a generous employer
but you didnt like him
shall we put it that i dont care very much for americans sir
have you ever been in america
no sir
do you remember reading in the paper of the armstrong kidnapping case
a little colour came into the mans cheeks
yes indeed sir
a little baby girl wasnt it
a very shocking affair
did you know that your employer mr ratchett was the principal instigator in that affair
no indeed sir
the valets tone held positive warmth and feeling for the first time
i can hardly believe it sir
nevertheless it is true
now to pass to your own movements last night
a matter of routine you understand
what did you do after leaving your master
i told mr macqueen sir that the master wanted him
then i went to my own compartment and read
your compartment wasthe end secondclass one sir
next to the diningcar
poirot was looking at his plan
i seeand you had which berth
the lower one sir
that is no
4
yes sir
is there anyone in with you
yes sir
a big italian fellow
does he speak english
well a kind of english sir
the valets tone was deprecating
hes been in americachicago i understand
do you and he talk together much
no sir
i prefer to read
poirot smiled
he could visualize the scenethe large voluble italian and the snub direct administered by the gentlemans gentleman
and what may i ask are you reading
he inquired
at present sir i am reading loves captive by mrs arabella richardson
a good story
i find it highly enjoyable sir
well let us continue
you returned to your compartment and read loves captive tillwhen
at about ten thirty sir this italian wanted to go to bed
so the conductor came and made the beds up
and then you went to bed and to sleep
i went to bed sir but i didnt sleep
why didnt you sleep
i had the toothache sir
oh lalathat is painful
most painful sir
did you do anything for it
i applied a little oil of cloves sir which relieved the pain a little but i was still not able to get to sleep
i turned the light on above my head and continued to readto take my mind off as it were
and did you not go to sleep at all
yes sir i dropped off about four in the morning
and your companion
the italian fellow
oh he just snored
he did not leave the compartment at all during the night
no sir
did you
no sir
did you hear anything during the night
i dont think so sir
nothing unusual i mean
the train being at a standstill made it all very quiet
poirot was silent a moment or two
then he spoke
well i think there is very little more to be said
you cannot throw any light upon the tragedy
im afraid not
im sorry sir
as far as you know was there any quarrel or bad blood between your master and mr
macqueen
oh
no sir
mr macqueen was a very pleasant gentleman
where were you in service before you came to mr
ratchett
with sir henry tomlinson sir in grosvenor square
why did you leave him
he was going to east africa sir and did not require my services any longer
but i am sure he will speak for me sir
i was with him some years
and you have been with mr ratchetthow long
just over nine months sir
thank you masterman
by the way are you a pipesmoker
no sir
i only smoke cigarettesgaspers sir
thank you that will do
poirot gave him a nod of dismissal
the valet hesitated a moment
youll excuse me sir but the elderly american lady is in what i might describe as a state sir
shes saying she knows all about the murderer
shes in a very excitable condition sir
in that case said poirot smiling we had better see her next
shall i tell her sir
shes been demanding to see someone in authority for a long time
the conductors been trying to pacify her
send her to us my friend said poirot
we will listen to her story now
4the evidence of the american ladymrs hubbard arrived in the diningcar in such a state of breathless excitement that she was hardly able to articulate her words
now just tell me thiswhos in authority here
ive got some very important information very important indeed and im going to tell it to someone in authority just as soon as i can
if you gentlemenher wavering glance fluctuated between the three men
poirot leaned forward
tell it to me madame he said
but first pray be seated
mrs hubbard plumped heavily down on to the seat opposite to him
what ive got to tell you is just this
there was a murder on the train last night and the murderer was right there in my compartment
she paused to give dramatic emphasis to her words
you are sure of this madame
of course im sure
the idea
i know what im talking about
ill tell you everything there is to tell
id gotten into bed and gone to sleep and suddenly i woke upeverything was darkand i knew there was a man in my compartment
i was just so scared i couldnt scream if you know what i mean
i just lay there and thought mercy im going to be killed
i just cant describe to you how i felt
these nasty trains i thought and all the outrages id read of
and i thought well anyway he wont get my jewellerybecause you see id put that in a stocking and hidden it under my pillowwhich isnt any too comfortable by the way kinda bumpy if you know what i mean
but thats neither here nor there
where was i
you realised madame that there was a man in your compartment
yes well i just lay there with my eyes closed and wondered what id do
and i thought well im just thankful that my daughter doesnt know the plight im in
and then somehow i got my wits about me and i felt about with my hand and i pressed the bell for the conductor
i pressed it and i pressed it but nothing happenedand i can tell you i thought my heart was going to stop beating
mercy i said to myself maybe theyve murdered every single soul on the train
it was at a standstill anyhow and there was a nasty quiet feel in the air
but i just went on pressing that bell and oh
the relief when i heard footsteps coming running down the corridor and a knock on the door
come in i screamed and i switched on the lights at the same time
and would you believe it there wasnt a soul there
this seemed to mrs hubbard to be a dramatic climax rather than an anticlimax
and what happened next madame
why i told the man what had happened and he didnt seem to believe me
seemed to imagine id dreamed the whole thing
i made him look under the seat though he said there wasnt room for a man to squeeze himself in there
it was plain enough that the man had got awaybut there had been a man there and it just made me mad the way the conductor tried to soothe me down
im not one to imagine things mri dont think i know your name
poirot madame and this is m bouc a director of the company and dr
constantine
mrs hubbard murmured pleased to meet you im sure to all three of them in an abstracted manner and then plunged once more into her recital
now im just not going to pretend i was as bright as i might have been
i got it into my head that it was the man from next doorthe poor fellow whos been killed
i told the conductor to look at the door between the compartments and sure enough it wasnt bolted
well i soon saw to that
i told him to bolt it then and there and after hed gone out i got up and put a suitcase against it to make sure
what time was this mrs
hubbard
well im sure i cant tell you
i never looked to see
i was so upset
and what is your theory now
why i should say it was just as plain as plain could be
the man in my compartment was the murderer
who else could he be
and you think he went back into the adjoining compartment
how do i know where he went
i had my eyes tight shut
he might have slipped out through the door into the corridor
well i couldnt say
you see i had my eyes tight shut
mrs hubbard sighed convulsively
mercy i was scared
if my daughter only knewyou do not think madame that what you heard was the noise of someone moving about next doorin the murdered mans compartment
no i do not mrwhat is itpoirot
the man was right there in the same compartment with me
and whats more ive got proof of it
triumphantly she hauled a large handbag into view and proceeded to burrow in its interior
she took out in turn two large clean handkerchiefs a pair of hornrimmed glasses a bottle of aspirin a packet of glaubers salts a celluloid tube of bright green peppermints a bunch of keys a pair of scissors a book of american express cheques a snapshot of an extraordinarily plainlooking child some letters five strings of pseudooriental beads and a small metal objecta button
you see this button
well its not one of my buttons
its not off anything ive got
i found it this morning when i got up
as she placed it on the table m bouc
leaned forward and gave an exclamation
but this is a button from the tunic of a wagon lit attendant
there way be a natural explanation for that said poirot
he turned gently to the lady
this button madame may have dropped from the conductors uniform either when he searched your cabin or when he was making the bed up last night
i just dont know whats the matter with all you people
seems as though you dont want to do anything but make objections
now listen here
i was reading a magazine last night before i went to sleep
before i turned the light out i placed that magazine on a little case that was standing on the floor near the window
have you got that
they assured her that they had
very well then
the conductor looked under the seat from near the door and then he came in and bolted the door between me and the next compartment but he never went near the window
well this morning that button was lying right on top of the magazine
what do you call that i should like to know
that madame i call evidence said poirot
the answer seemed to appease the lady
it makes me madder than a hornet to be disbelieved she explained
you have given us most interesting and valuable evidence said poirot soothingly
now may i ask you a few questions
why certainly
how was it since you were nervous of this man ratchett that you hadnt already bolted the door between the compartments
i had returned mrs hubbard promptly
oh you had
well as a matter of fact i asked that swedish creaturea pleasant soulif it was bolted and she said it was
how was it you couldnt see for yourself
because i was in bed and my spongebag was hanging on the doorhandle
what time was it when you asked her to do this for you
now let me think
it must have been round about halfpast ten or a quarter to eleven
shed come along to see if i had an aspirin
i told her where to find it and she got it out of my grip
you yourself were in bed
yes
suddenly she laughed
poor soulshe was so upset
you see shed opened the door of the next compartment by mistake
mr
ratchetts
yes
you know how difficult it is as you come along the train and all the doors are shut
she opened his by mistake
she was very distressed about it
hed laughed it seemed and i guess he said something not quite nice
poor thing she certainly was upset
oh
i make mistake she said
i ashamed make mistake
not nice man she said
he say you too old
 dr constantine sniggered and mrs hubbard immediately froze him with a glance
he wasnt a nice kind of man she said to say a thing like that to a lady
its not right to laugh at such things
dr constantine hastily apologised
did you hear any noise from mr ratchetts compartment after that
asked poirot
wellnot exactly
what do you mean by that madame
well she paused
he snored
ahhe snored did he
terribly
the night before it kept me awake
you didnt hear him snore after you had had the scare about a man being in your compartment
why mr poirot how could i
he was dead
ah yes truly said poirot
he appeared confused
do you remember the affair of the armstrong kidnap ping mrs
hubbard
he asked
yes indeed i do
and how the wretch that did it escaped scotfree
my id have liked to get my hands on him
he has not escaped
he is dead
he died last night
you dont mean
mrs hubbard half rose from her chair in excitement
but yes i do
ratchett was the man
well
well to think of that
i must write and tell my daughter
now didnt i tell you last night that that man had an evil face
i was right you see
my daughter always says when mammas got a hunch you can bet your bottom dollar its ok
were you acquainted with any of the armstrong family mrs
hubbard
no
they moved in a very exclusive circle
but ive always heard that mrs armstrong was a perfectly lovely woman and that her husband worshipped her
well mrs hubbard you have helped us very muchvery much indeed
perhaps you will give me your full name
why certainly
caroline martha hubbard
will you write your address down here
mrs hubbard did so without ceasing to speak
i just cant get over it
cassettion this train
i had a hunch about that man didnt i mr
poirot
yes indeed madame
by the way have you a scarlet silk dressinggown
mercy what a funny question
why no
ive got two dressinggowns with mea pink flannel one thats kind of cosy for on board ship and one my daughter gave me as a presenta kind of local affair in purple silk
but what in creation do you want to know about my dressinggowns for
well you see madame someone in a scarlet kimono entered either your or mr ratchetts compartment last night
it is as you said just now very difficult when all the doors are shut to know which compartment is which
well no one in a scarlet dressinggown came into my compartment
then she must have gone into mr
ratchetts
mrs hubbard pursed her lips together and said grimly that wouldnt surprise me any
poirot leaned forward
so you heard a womans voice next door
i dont know how you guessed that mr poirot
i dont really
butwellas a matter of fact i did
but when i asked you just now if you heard anything next door you only said you heard mr ratchett snoring
well that was true enough
he did snore part of the time
as for the other mrs hubbard got rather embarrassed
it isnt a very nice thing to speak about
what time was it when you heard a womans voice
i cant tell you
i just woke up for a minute and heard a woman talking and it was plain enough where she was
so i just thought well thats the kind of man he is
im not surprisedand then i went to sleep again
and im sure i should never have mentioned anything of the kind to three strange gentlemen if you hadnt dragged it out of me
was it before the scare about the man in your compartment or after
why thats like what you said just now
he wouldnt have had a woman talking to him if he were dead would he
pardon
you must think me very stupid madame
i guess even you get kinda muddled now and then
i just cant get over its being that monster cassetti
what my daughter will saypoirot managed adroitly to help the good lady to replace the contents of her handbag and he then shepherded her towards the door
at the last moment he saidyou have dropped your handkerchief madame
mrs hubbard looked at the little scrap of cambric he held out to her
thats not mine mr poirot
ive got mine right here
pardon
i thought as it had the initial h on itwell now thats funny but its certainly not mine
mine are marked cmh and theyre sensible thingsnot expensive paris fallals
what good is a handkerchief like that to anybodys nose
none of the three men seemed to have an answer to this question and mrs hubbard sailed out triumphantly
5the evidence of the swedish ladym bouc was handling the button that mrs hubbard had left behind her
this button
i cannot understand it
does it mean that after all pierre michel is involved in some way
he asked
he paused then continued as poirot did not reply
what have you to say my friend
that button it suggests possibilities said poirot thoughtfully
let us interview next the swedish lady before we discuss the evidence that we have heard
he sorted through the pile of passports in front of him
ah
here we are
greta ohlsson age fortynine
m bouc gave directions to the restaurant attendant and presently the lady with the yellowish grey bun of hair and the long mild sheeplike face was ushered in
she peered shortsightedly at poirot through her glasses but was quite calm
it transpired that she understood and spoke french so the conversation took place in that language
poirot first asked her the questions to which he already knew the answersher name age and address
he then asked her her occupation
she was she told him matron in a missionary school near stamboul
she was a trained nurse
you know of course of what took place last night mademoiselle
naturally
it is very dreadful
and the american lady tells me that the murderer was actually in her compartment
i hear mademoiselle that you were the last person to see the murdered man alive
i do not know
it may be so
i opened the door of his compartment by mistake
i was much ashamed
it was a most awkward mistake
you actually saw him
yes
he was reading a book
i apologised quickly and withdrew
did he say anything to you
a slight flush showed on the worthy ladys cheek
he laughed and said a few words
ii did not quite catch them
and what did you do after that mademoiselle
asked poirot passing from the subject tactfully
i went in to the american lady mrs hubbard
i asked her for some aspirin and she gave it to me
did she ask you whether the communicating door between her compartment and that of mr ratchett was bolted
yes
and was it
yes
and after that
after that i went back to my compartment took the aspirin and lay down
what time was all this
when i got into bed it was five minutes to eleven
i know because i looked at my watch before i wound it up
did you go to sleep quickly
not very quickly
my head got better but i lay awake some time
had the train come to a stop before you went to sleep
i do not think so
we stopped i think at a station just as i was getting drowsy
that would be vincovci
now your compartment mademoiselle is this one
he indicated it on the plan
that is so yes
you had the upper or the lower berth
the lower berth no
10
and you had a companion
yes a young english lady
very nice very amiable
she had travelled from baghdad
after the train left vincovci did she leave the compartment
no i am sure she did not
why are you sure if you were asleep
i sleep very lightly
i am used to waking at a sound
i am sure that if she had come down from the berth above i should have awakened
did you yourself leave the compartment
not until this morning
have you a scarlet silk kimono mademoiselle
no indeed
i have a good comfortable dressinggown of jaeger material
and the lady with you miss debenham
what colour is her dressinggown
a pale mauve aba such as you buy in the east
poirot nodded
then he asked in a friendly tone why are you taking this journey
a holiday
yes i am going home for a holiday
but first i am going to lausanne to stay with a sister for a week or so
perhaps you will be so amiable as to write me down the name and address of your sister
with pleasure
she took the paper and pencil he gave her and wrote down the name and address as requested
have you ever been in america mademoiselle
no
i very nearly went once
i was to go with an invalid lady but the plan was cancelled at the last moment
i much regretted this
they are very good the americans
they give much money to found schools and hospitals
and they are very practical
do you remember hearing of the armstrong kidnapping case
no what was that
poirot explained
greta ohlsson was indignant
her yellow bun of hair quivered with her emotion
that there are in the world such evil men
it tries ones faith
the poor mothermy heart aches for her
the amiable swede departed her kindly face flushed her eyes suffused with tears
poirot was writing busily on a sheet of paper
what is it you write there my friend
asked m bouc
mon cher it is my habit to be neat and orderly
i make here a little chronological table of events
he finished writing and passed the paper to m bouc
915 train leaves belgrade
about 940 valet leaves ratchett with sleeping draught beside him
about 1000 macqueen leaves ratchett
about 1040 greta ohlsson sees ratchett last seen alive
nb
he was awake reading a book
010 train leaves vincovci late
030 train runs into a snowdrift
037 ratchetts bell rings
conductor answers it
ratchett says ce nest rien
je me suis trompe
about 117 mrs hubbard thinks man is in her carriage
rings for conductor
m bouc nodded approval
that is very clear he said
there is nothing there that strikes you as at all odd
no it seems all quite clear and aboveboard
it seems quite plain that the crime was committed at 115
the evidence of the watch shows us that and mrs hubbards story fits in
for my mind i will make a guess at the identity of the murderer
i say my friend that it is the big italian
he comes from americafrom chicagoand remember an italians weapon is the knife and he stabs not once but several times
that is true
without a doubt that is the solution of the mystery
doubtless he and this ratchett were in this kidnapping business together
cassetti is an italian name
in some way ratchett did on him what they call the doublecross
the italian tracks him down sends him warning letters first and finally revenges himself upon him in a brutal way
it is all quite simple
poirot shook his head doubtfully
it is hardly so simple as that i fear he murmured
me i am convinced it is the truth said m bouc becoming more and more enamoured of his theory
and what about the valet with the toothache who swears that the italian never left the compartment
that is the difficulty
poirot twinkled
yes it is annoying that
unlucky for your theory and extremely lucky for our italian friend that m ratchetts valet should have had the toothache
it will be explained said m bouc with magnificent certainty
poirot shook his head again
no it is hardly so simple as that he murmured again
6the evidence of the russian princesslet us hear what pierre michel has to say about this button he said
the wagon lit conductor was recalled
he looked at them inquiringly
m bouc cleared his throat
michel he said here is a button from your tunic
it was found in the american ladys compartment
what have you to say for yourself about it
the conductors hand went automatically to his tunic
i have lost no button monsieur he said
there must be some mistake
that is very odd
i cannot account for it monsieur
the man seemed astonished but not in any way guilty or confused
m bouc said meaningly owing to the circumstances in which it was found it seems fairly certain that this button was dropped by the man who was in mrs hubbards compartment last night when she rang the bell
but monsieur there was no one there
the lady must have imagined it
she did not imagine it michel
the assassin of m ratchett passed that wayand dropped that button
as the significance of m boucs words became plain to him pierre michel flew into a violent state of agitation
it is not true monsieur it is not true
he cried
you are accusing me of the crime
me i am innocent
i am absolutely innocent
why should i want to kill a monsieur whom i have never seen before
where were you when mrs hubbards bell rang
i told you monsieur in the next coach talking to my colleague
we will send for him
do so monsieur i implore you do so
the conductor of the next coach was summoned
he immediately confirmed pierre michels statement
he added that the conductor from the bucharest coach had also been there
the three of them had been discussing the situation caused by the snow
they had been talking some ten minutes when michel fancied he heard a bell
as he opened the doors connecting the two coaches they had all heard it plainlya bell ringing repeatedly
michel had run posthaste to answer it
so you see monsieur i am not guilty cried michel anxiously
and this button from a wagon lit tunic how do you explain it
i cannot monsieur
it is a mystery to me
all my buttons are intact
both of the other conductors also declared that they had not lost a button also that they had not been inside mrs hubbards compartment at any time
calm yourself michel said m bouc and cast your mind back to the moment when you ran to answer mrs hubbards bell
did you meet anyone at all in the corridor
no monsieur
did you see anyone going away from you down the corridor in the other direction
again no monsieur
odd said m bouc
not so very said poirot
it is a question of time
mrs hubbard wakes to find someone in her compartment
for a minute or two she lies paralysed her eyes shut
probably it was then that the man slipped out into the corridor
then she starts ringing the bell
but the conductor does not come at once
it is only the third or fourth peal that he hears
i should say myself that there was ample timefor what
for what mon cher
remember there are thick drifts of snow all round the train
there are two courses open to our mysterious assassin said poirot slowly
he could retreat into either of the toilets orhe could disappear into one of the compartments
but they were all occupied
yes
you mean that he could retreat into his own compartment
poirot nodded
it fitsit fits murmured m bouc
during that ten minutes absence of the conductor the murderer comes from his own compartment goes into ratchetts kills him locks and chains the door on the inside goes out through mrs hubbards compartment and is back safely in his own compartment by the time the conductor arrives
poirot murmured it is not quite so simple as that my friend
our friend the doctor here will tell you so
with a gesture m bouc signified that the three conductors might depart
we have still to see eight passengers said poirot
five firstclass passengersprincess dragomiroff count and countess andrenyi colonel arbuthnot and mr hardman
three secondclass passengersmiss debenham antonio foscarelli and the ladysmaid fraulein schmidt
whom will you see firstthe italian
how you harp on your italian
no we will start at the top of the tree
perhaps madame la princesse will be so good as to spare us a few moments of her time
convey that message to her michel
oui monsieur said the conductor who was just leaving the car
tell her we can wait on her in her compartment if she does not wish to put herself to the trouble of coming here called m bouc
but princess dragomiroff declined to take this course
she appeared in the diningcar inclined her head slightly and sat down opposite poirot
her small toadlike face looked even yellower than the day before
she was certainly ugly and yet like the toad she had eyes like jewels dark and imperious revealing latent energy and an intellectual force that could be felt at once
her voice was deep very distinct with a slight grating quality in it
she cut short a flowery phrase of apology from m bouc
you need not offer apologies messieurs
i understand a murder has taken place
naturally you must interview all the passengers
i shall be glad to give you all the assistance in my power
you are most amiable madame said poirot
not at all
it is a duty
what do you wish to know
your full christian names and address madame
perhaps you would prefer to write them yourself
poirot proffered a sheet of paper and pencil but the princess waved them aside
you can write it she said
there is nothing difficult
natalia dragomiroff 17 avenue kleber paris
you are travelling home from constantinople madame
yes
i have been staying at the austrian embassy
my maid is with me
would you be so good as to give me a brief account of your movements last night from dinner onwards
willingly
i directed the conductor to make up my bed whilst i was in the diningcar
i retired to bed immediately after dinner
i read until the hour of eleven when i turned out my light
i was unable to sleep owing to certain rheumatic pains from which i suffer
at about a quarter to one i rang for my maid
she massaged me and then read aloud till i felt sleepy
i cannot say exactly when she left me
it may have been half an hour afterward it may have been later
the train had stopped then
the train had stopped
you heard nothingnothing unusual during the time madame
i heard nothing unusual
what is your maids name
hildegarde schmidt
she has been with you long
fifteen years
you consider her trustworthy
absolutely
her people come from an estate of my late husbands in germany
you have been in america i presume madame
the abrupt change of subject made the old lady raise her eyebrows
many times
were you at any time acquainted with a family of the name of armstronga family in which a tragedy occurred
with some emotion in her voice the old lady said you speak of friends of mine monsieur
you knew colonel armstrong well then
i knew him slightly but his wife sonia armstrong was my goddaughter
i was on terms of friendship with her mother the actress linda arden
linda arden was a great genius one of the greatest tragic actresses in the world
as lady macbeth as magda there was no one to touch her
i was not only an admirer of her art i was a personal friend
she is dead
no no she is alive but she lives in complete retirement
her health is very delicate and she has to lie on a sofa most of the time
there was i think a second daughter
yes much younger than mrs
armstrong
and she is alive
certainly
where is she
the old woman bent an acute glance at him
i must ask you the reason for these questions
what have they to do with the matter in handthe murder on this train
they are connected in this way madame the man who was murdered was the man responsible for the kidnapping and murder of mrs armstrongs child
ah
the straight brows came together
princess dragomiroff drew herself a little more erect
in my view then this murder is an entirely admirable happening
you will pardon my slightly biased point of view
it is most natural madame
and now to return to the question you did not answer
where is the younger daughter of linda arden the sister of mrs
armstrong
i honestly cannot tell you monsieur
i have lost touch with the younger generation
i believe she married an englishman some years ago and went to england but at the moment i cannot recollect the name
she paused a minute and then saidis there anything further you want to ask me gentlemen
only one thing madame a somewhat personal question
the colour of your dressinggown
she raised her eyebrows slightly
i must suppose you have a reason for such a question
my dressinggown is of black satin
there is nothing more madame
i am much obliged to you for answering my questions so promptly
she made a slight gesture with her heavily beringed hand
then as she rose and the others rose with her she stopped
you will excuse me monsieur she said but may i ask your name
your face is somehow familiar to me
my name madame is hercule poirotat your service
she was silent a minute then hercule poirot she said
yes
i remember now
this is destiny
she walked away very erect a little stiff in her movements
voila une grande dame said m bouc
what do you think of her my friend
but hercule poirot merely shook his head
i am wondering he said what she meant by destiny
7the evidence of count and countess andrenyicount and countess andrenyi were next summoned
the count however entered the diningcar alone
there was no doubt that he was a finelooking man seen face to face
he was at least six feet in height with broad shoulders and slender hips
he was dressed in very wellcut english tweeds and might have been taken for an englishman had it not been for the length of his moustache and something in the line of the cheekbone
well messieurs he said what can i do for you
you understand monsieur said poirot that in view of what has occurred i am obliged to put certain questions to all the passengers
perfectly perfectly said the count easily
i quite understand your position
not i fear that my wife and i can do much to assist you
we were asleep and heard nothing at all
are you aware of the identity of the deceased monsieur
i understood it was the big americana man with a decidedly unpleasant face
he sat at that table at meal times
he indicated with a nod of his head the table at which ratchett and macqueen had sat
yes yes monsieur you are perfectly correct
i meantdid you know the name of the man
no
the count looked thoroughly puzzled by poirots queries
if you want to know his name he said surely it is on his passport
the name on his passport is ratchett said poirot
but that monsieur is not his real name
he is the man cassetti who was responsible for a celebrated kidnapping outrage in america
he watched the count closely as he spoke but the latter seemed quite unaffected by this piece of news
he merely opened his eyes a little
ah
he said
that certainly should throw light upon the matter
an extraordinary country america
you have been there perhaps monsieur le comte
i was in washington for a year
you knew perhaps the armstrong family
armstrongarmstrongit is difficult to recall
one met so many
he smiled shrugged his shoulders
but to come back to the matter in hand gentlemen he said
what more can i do to assist you
you retired to restwhen monsieur le comte
hercule poirots eyes stole to his plan
count and countess andrenyi occupied compartment nos
12 and 13 adjoining
we had one compartment made up for the night whilst we were in the diningcar
on returning we sat in the other for a whilewhich number would that be
no
13
we played piquet together
at about eleven oclock my wife retired for the night
the conductor made up my compartment and i also went to bed
i slept soundly until morning
did you notice the stopping of the train
i was not aware of it till this morning
and your wife
the count smiled
my wife always takes a sleeping draught when travelling by train
she took her usual dose of trional
he paused
i am sorry i am not able to assist you in any way
poirot passed him a sheet of paper and a pen
thank you monsieur le comte
it is a formality but will you just let me have your name and address
the count wrote slowly and carefully
it is just as well that i should write this for you he said pleasantly
the spelling of my country estate is a little difficult for those unacquainted with the language
he passed the paper across to poirot and rose
it will be quite unnecessary for my wife to come here he said
she can tell you nothing more than i have
a little gleam came into poirots eye
doubtless doubtless he said
but all the same i think i should like to have just one little word with madame la comtesse
i assure you it is quite unnecessary
the counts voice rang out authoritatively
poirot blinked gently at him
it will be a mere formality he said
but you understand it is necessary for my report
as you please
the count gave way grudgingly
he made a short foreign bow and left the diningcar
poirot reached out a hand to a passport
it set out the counts names and titles
he passed on to the further information
accompanied by wife christian name elena maria maiden name goldenberg age twenty
a spot of grease had been dropped on it at some time by a careless official
a diplomatic passport said m bouc
we must be careful my friend to give no offence
these people can have nothing to do with the murder
be easy mon vieux i will be most tactful
a mere formality
his voice dropped as the countess andrenyi entered the diningcar
she looked timid and extremely charming
you wish to see me messieurs
a mere formality madam la comtesse
poirot rose gallantly bowed her into the seat opposite him
it is only to ask you if you saw or heard anything last night that may throw light upon this matter
nothing at all monsieur
i was asleep
you did not hear for instance a commotion going on in the compartment next to yours
the american lady who occupies it had quite an attack of hysterics and rang for the conductor
i heard nothing monsieur
you see i had taken a sleeping draught
ah
i comprehend
well i need not detain you further
then as she rose swiftlyjust one little minute
these particularsyour maiden name age and so onthey are correct
quite correct monsieur
perhaps you will sign this memorandum to that effect then
she signed quickly in a graceful slanting handwritingelena andrenyi
did you accompany your husband to america madame
no monsieur
she smiled flushed a little
we were not married then we have been married only a year
ah yes thank you madame
by the way does your husband smoke
she stared at him as she stood poised for departure
yes
a pipe
no
cigarettes and cigars
ah
thank you
she lingered her eyes watching him curiously
lovely eyes they were dark and almondshaped with very long black lashes that swept the exquisite pallor of her cheeks
her lips very scarlet in the foreign fashion were parted just a little
she looked exotic and beautiful
why did you ask me that
madame poirot waved an airy hand detectives have to ask all sorts of questions
for instance perhaps you will tell me the colour of your dressinggown
she stared at him
then she laughed
it is corncoloured chiffon
is that really important
very important madame
she asked curiously are you really a detective then
at your service madame
i thought there were no detectives on the train when it passed through jugoslavianot until one got to italy
i am not a jugoslavian detective madame
i am an international detective
you belong to the league of nations
i belong to the world madame said poirot dramatically
he went on i work mainly in london
you speak english
he added in that language
i speak a leetle yes
her accent was charming
poirot bowed once more
we will not detain you further madame
you see it was not so very terrible
she smiled inclined her head and departed
elle est jolie femme said m bouc appreciatively
he sighed
well that did not advance us much
no said poirot
two people who saw nothing and heard nothing
shall we now see the italian
poirot did not reply for a moment
he was studying a grease spot on a hungarian diplomatic passport
8the evidence of colonel arbuthnotpoirot roused himself with a slight start
his eyes twinkled a little as they met the eager ones of m bouc
ah
my dear old friend he said you see i have become what they call the snob
the first class i feel it should be attended to before the second class
next i think we will interview the goodlooking colonel arbuthnot
finding the colonels french to be of a severely limited description poirot conducted his interrogatory in english
arbuthnots name age home address and exact military standing were all ascertained
poirot proceededit is that you come home from india on what is called the leavewhat we can call en permission
colonel arbuthnot uninterested in what a pack of foreigners called anything replied with true british brevity yes
but you do not come home on the p  o
boat
no
why not
i chose to come by the overland route for reasons of my own
and that his manner seemed to say is one for you you interfering little jackanapes
you came straight through from india
the colonel replied drily i stopped for one night to see ur of the chaldees and for three days in baghdad with the aoc who happens to be an old friend of mine
you stopped three days in baghdad
i understand that the young english lady miss debenham also comes from baghdad
perhaps you met her there
no i did not
i first met miss debenham when she and i shared the railway convoy car from kirkuk to nissibin
poirot leaned forward
he became persuasive and a little more foreign than he need have been
monsieur i am about to appeal to you
you and miss debenham are the only two english people on the train
it is necessary that i should ask you each your opinion of the other
highly irregular said colonel arbuthnot coldly
not so
you see this crime it was most probably committed by a woman
the man was stabbed no fewer than twelve times
even the chef de train said at once it is a woman
well then what is my first task
to give all the women travelling on the istanbulcalais coach what americans call the onceover
but to judge of an englishwoman is difficult
they are very reserved the english
so i appeal to you monsieur in the interest of justice
what sort of person is this miss debenham
what do you know about her
miss debenham said the colonel with some warmth is a lady
ah
said poirot with every appearance of being much gratified
so you do not think that she is likely to be implicated in this crime
the idea is absurd said arbuthnot
the man was a perfect strangershe had never seen him before
did she tell you so
she did
she commented at once upon his somewhat unpleasant appearance
if a woman is concerned as you seem to think to my mind without any evidence but on a mere assumption i can assure you that miss debenham could not possibly be implicated
you feel warmly in the matter said poirot with a smile
colonel arbuthnot gave him a cold stare
i really dont know what you mean he said
the stare seemed to abash poirot
he dropped his eyes and began fiddling with the papers in front of him
all this is by the way he said
let us be practical and come to facts
this crime we have reason to believe took place at a quarter past one last night
it is part of the necessary routine to ask everyone on the train what he or she was doing at that time
quite so
at a quarter past one to the best of my belief i was talking to the young american fellowsecretary to the dead man
ah
were you in his compartment or was he in yours
i was in his
that is the young man of the name of macqueen
yes
he was a friend or acquaintance of yours
no i never saw him before this journey
we fell into casual conversation yesterday and both became interested
i dont as a rule like americanshavent any use for empoirot smiled remembering macqueens strictures on britishers
but i liked this young fellow
hed got hold of some tomfool idiotic ideas about the situation in india
thats the worst of americanstheyre so sentimental and idealistic
well he was interested in what i had to tell him
ive had nearly thirty years experience of the country
and i was interested in what he had to tell me about the working of prohibition in america
then we got down to world politics in general
i was quite surprised to look at my watch and find it was a quarter to two
that is the time you broke up this conversation
yes
what did you do then
walked along to my own compartment and turned in
your bed was made up ready
yes
that is the compartmentlet me seeno
15the one next but one to the end away from the diningcar
yes
where was the conductor when you went to your compartment
sitting at the end at a little table
as a matter of fact macqueen called him just as i went in to my own compartment
why did he call him
to make up his bed i suppose
the compartment hadnt been made up for the night
now colonel arbuthnot i want you to think carefully
during the time you were talking to mr macqueen did anyone pass along the corridor outside the door
a good many people i should think
i wasnt paying attention
ah
but i am referring tolet us say the last hour and a half of your conversation
you got out at vincovci didnt you
yes but only for about a minute
there was a blizzard on
the cold was something frightful
made one quite thankful to get back to the fug though as a rule i think the way these trains are overheated is something scandalous
m bouc sighed
it is very difficult to please everybody he said
the english they open everythingthen others they come along and shut everything
it is very difficult
neither poirot nor colonel arbuthnot paid any attention to him
now monsieur cast your mind back said poirot encouragingly
it was cold outside
you have returned to the train
you sit down again you smokeperhaps a cigaretteperhaps a pipehe paused for the fraction of a second
a pipe for me
macqueen smoked cigarettes
the train starts again
you smoke your pipe
you discuss the state of europeof the world
it is late now
most people have retired for the night
does anyone pass the door
think
arbuthnot frowned in the effort of remembrance
difficult to say he said
you see i wasnt paying any attention
but you have the soldiers observation for detail
you notice without noticing so to speak
the colonel thought again but shook his head
i couldnt say
i dont remember anyone passing except the conductor
wait a minuteand there was a woman i think
you saw her
was she oldyoung
didnt see her
wasnt looking that way
just a rustle and a sort of smell of scent
scent
a good scent
well rather fruity if you know what i mean
i mean youd smell it a hundred yards away
but mind you the colonel went on hastily this may have been earlier in the evening
you see as you said just now it was just one of those things you notice without noticing so to speak
some time that evening i said to myselfwomanscentgot it on pretty thick
but when it was i cant be sure except thatwhy yes it must have been after vincovci
why
because i remembersniffing you knowjust when i was talking about the utter washout stalins five year plan was turning out
i know the idea woman brought the idea of the position of women in russia into my mind
and i know we hadnt got on to russia until pretty near the end of our talk
you cant pin it down more definitely than that
nno
it must have been roughly within the last halfhour
it was after the train had stopped
the other nodded
yes im almost sure it was
well we will pass from that
have you ever been in america colonel arbuthnot
never
dont want to go
did you ever know a colonel armstrong
armstrongarmstrongive known two or three armstrongs
there was tommy armstrong in the 60thyou dont mean him
and selby armstronghe was killed on the somme
i mean the colonel armstrong who married an american wife and whose only child was kidnapped and killed
ah yes i remember reading about thatshocking affair
i dont think i actually ever came across the fellow though of course i knew of him
toby armstrong
nice fellow
everybody liked him
he had a very distinguished career
got the vc
the man who was killed last night was the man responsible for the murder of colonel armstrongs child
arbuthnots face grew rather grim
then in my opinion the swine deserved what he got
though i would have preferred to see him properly hangedor electrocuted i suppose over there
in fact colonel arbuthnot you prefer law and order to private vengeance
well you cant go about having blood feuds and stabbing each other like corsicans or the mafia said the colonel
say what you like trial by jury is a sound system
poirot looked at him thoughtfully for a minute or two
yes he said
i am sure that would be your view
well colonel arbuthnot i do not think there is anything more i have to ask you
there is nothing you yourself can recall last night that in any way snuck youor shall we say strikes you now looking backas suspicious
arbuthnot considered for a moment or two
no he said
nothing at all
unless he hesitated
but yes continue i pray of you
well its nothing really said the colonel slowly
but you said anything
yes yes
go on
oh
its nothing
a mere detail
but as i got back to my compartment i noticed that the door of the one beyond minethe end one you knowyes no
16
well the door of it was not quite closed
and the fellow inside peered out in a furtive sort of way
then he pulled the door to quickly
of course i know theres nothing in thatbut it just struck me as a bit odd
i mean its quite usual to open a door and stick your head out if you want to see anything
but it was the furtive way he did it that caught my attention
yees said poirot doubtfully
i told you there was nothing to it said arbuthnot apologetically
but you know what it isearly hours of the morningeverything very still
the thing had a sinister looklike a detective story
all nonsense really
he rose
well if you dont want me any morethank you colonel arbuthnot there is nothing else
the soldier hesitated for a minute
his first natural distaste for being questioned by foreigners had evaporated
about miss debenham he said rather awkwardly
you can take it from me that shes all right
shes a pukka sahib
flushing a little he withdrew
what asked dr constantine with interest does a pukka sahib mean
it means said poirot that miss debenhams father and brothers were at the same kind of school as colonel arbuthnot was
oh
said dr constantine disappointed
then it has nothing to do with the crime at all
exactly said poirot
he fell into a reverie beating a light tattoo on the table
then he looked up
colonel arbuthnot smokes a pipe he said
in the compartment of mr ratchett i found a pipecleaner
mr ratchett smoked only cigars
you think
he is the only man so far who admits to smoking a pipe
and he knew of colonel armstrongperhaps actually did know him though he wont admit it
so you think it possible
poirot shook his head violently
that is just itit is impossiblequite impossiblethat an honourable slightly stupid upright englishman should stab an enemy twelve times with a knife
do you not feel my friends how impossible it is
that is the psychology said m bouc
and one must respect the psychology
this crime has a signature and it is certainly not the signature of colonel arbuthnot
but now to our next interview
this time m bouc did not mention the italian
but he thought of him
9the evidence of mr hardmanthe last of the firstclass passengers to be interviewed mr hardman was the big flamboyant american who had shared a table with the italian and the valet
he wore a somewhat loud check suit a pink shirt and a flashy tiepin and was rolling something round his tongue as he entered the diningcar
he had a big fleshy coarsefeatured face with a goodhumoured expression
morning gentlemen he said
what can i do for you
you have heard of this murder mrerhardman
sure
he shifted the chewing gum deftly
we are of necessity interviewing all the passengers on the train
thats all right by me
guess thats the only way to tackle the job
poirot consulted the passport lying in front of him
you are cyrus bethman hardman united states subject fortyone years of age travelling salesman for typewriting ribbons
ok
thats me
you are travelling from stamboul to paris
thats so
reason
business
do you always travel firstclass mr
hardman
yes sir
the firm pays my travelling expenses 
he winked
now mr hardman we come to the events of last night
the american nodded
what can you tell us about the matter
exactly nothing at all
ah that is a pity
perhaps mr hardman you will tell us exactly what you did last night from dinner onwards
for the first time the american did not seem ready with his reply
at last he said excuse me gentlemen but just who are you
put me wise
this is m bouc a director of the compagnie des wagons lits
this gentleman is the doctor who examined the body
and you yourself
i am hercule poirot
i am engaged by the company to investigate this matter
ive heard of you said mr hardman
he reflected a minute or two longer
guess id better come clean
it will certainly be advisable for you to tell us all you know said poirot drily
youd have said a mouthful if there was anything i did know
but i dont
i know nothing at alljust as i said
but i ought to know something
thats what makes me sore
i ought to
please explain mr
hardman
mr hardman sighed removed the chewing gum and dived into a pocket
at the same time his whole personality seemed to undergo a change
he became less of a stage character and more of a real person
the resonant nasal tones of his voice became modified
that passports a bit of bluff he said
thats who i really am
poirot scrutinised the card flipped across to him
m bouc peered over his shoulder
poirot knew the name as that of one of the bestknown and most reputable private detective agencies in new york
now mr hardman he said let us hear the meaning of this
sure
things came about this way
id come over to europe trailing a couple of crooksnothing to do with this business
the chase ended in stamboul
i wired the chief and got his instructions to return and i would have been making my tracks back to little old new york when i got this
he pushed across a letter
the tokatllan hoteldear siryou have been pointed out to me as an operative of the mcneil detective agency
kindly report at my suite at four oclock this afternoon
s e ratchetteh bien
i reported at the time stated and mr ratchett put me wise to the situation
he showed me a couple of letters hed got
he was alarmed
pretended not to be but he was rattled all right
he put up a proposition to me
i was to travel by the same train as he did to parrus and see that nobody got him
well gentlemen i did travel by the same train and in spite of me somebody did get him
i certainly feel sore about it
it doesnt look any too good for me
did he give you any indication of the line you were to take
sure
he had it all taped out
it was his idea that i should travel in the compartment alongside his
well that blew up right at the start
the only place i could get was berth no
16 and i had a job getting that
i guess the conductor likes to keep that compartment up his sleeve
but thats neither here nor there
when i looked all round the situation it seemed to me that no
16 was a pretty good strategic position
there was only the diningcar in front of the stamboul sleepingcar and the door onto the platform at the front end was barred at night
the only way a thug could come was through the rearend door to the platform or along the train from the rear and in either case hed have to pass right by my compartment
you had no idea i suppose of the identity of the possible assailant
well i knew what he looked like
mr ratchett described him to me
what
all three men leaned forward eagerly
hardman went on
a small mandarkwith a womanish kind of voice
thats what the old man said
said too that he didnt think it would be the first night out more likely the second or third
he knew something said m bouc
he certainly knew more than he told his secretary commented poirot thoughtfully
did he tell you anything about this enemy of his
did he for instance say why his life was threatened
no he was kinda reticent about that part of it
just said the fellowwas out for his blood and meant to get it
a small mandarkwith a womanish voice repeated poirot thoughtfully
then fixing a sharp glance on hardman he asked you knew who he really was of course
which mister
ratchett
you recognised him
i dont get you
ratchett was cassetti the armstrong murderer
mr hardman gave vent to a prolonged whistle
that certainly is some surprise
he said
yes sir
no i didnt recognise him
i was away out west when that case came on
i suppose i saw photos of him in the papers but i wouldnt recognise my own mother when a newspaper photographer got through with her
well i dont doubt that a few people had it in for cassetti all right
do you know of anyone connected with the armstrong case who answers to that description smalldarkwomanish voice
hardman reflected a minute or two
its hard to say
pretty nearly everyone connected with that case is dead
there was the girl who threw herself out of the window remember
sure
thats a good point that
she was a foreigner of some kind
maybe she had some wop relations
but youve got to remember that there were other cases besides the armstrong one
cassetti had been running this kidnapping stunt for some time
you cant concentrate on that only
ah but we have reason to believe that this crime is connected with the armstrong case
mr hardman cocked an inquiring eye
poirot did not respond
the american shook his head
i cant call to mind anybody answering that description in the armstrong case he said slowly
but of course i wasnt in it and didnt know much about it
well continue your narrative mr
hardman
theres very little to tell
i got my sleep in the daytime and stayed awake on the watch at night
nothing suspicious happened the first night
last night was the same as far as i was concerned
i had my door a little ajar and watched
no stranger passed
you are sure of that mr
hardman
im plumb certain
nobody got on that train from outside and nobody came along the train from the rear carriages
ill take my oath on that
could you see the conductor from your position
sure
he sits on that little seat almost flush with my door
did he leave that seat at all after the train stopped at vincovci
that was the last station
why yes he answered a couple of bellsthat would be just after the train came to a halt for good
then after that he went past me into the rear coachwas there about a quarter of an hour
there was a bell ringing like mad and he came back running
i stepped out into the corridor to see what it was all aboutfelt a mite nervous you understandbut it was only the american dame
she was raising hell about something or other i grinned
then he went on to another compartment and came back and got a bottle of mineral water for someone
after that he settled down in his seat till he went up to the far end to make somebodys bed up
i dont think he stirred after that until about five oclock this morning
did he doze off at all
that i cant say
he may have
poirot nodded
automatically his hands straightened the papers on the table
he picked up the official card once more
be so good as just to initial this he said
the other complied
there is no one i suppose who can confirm your story of your identity mr
hardman
on this train
well not exactly
unless it might be young macqueen
i know him well enoughive seen him in his fathers office in new york
but thats not to say hell remember me from a crowd of other operatives
no mr poirot youll have to wait and cable new york when the snow lets up
but its ok
im not telling the tale
well so long gentlemen
pleased to have met you mr
poirot
poirot proffered his cigarette case
but perhaps you prefer a pipe
not me
he helped himself then strode briskly off
the three men looked at each other
you think he is genuine
asked dr constantine
yes yes
i know the type
besides it is a story that would be very easy to disprove
he has given us a piece of very interesting evidence said m bouc
yes indeed
a small mandarkwith a highpitched voice said m bouc thoughtfully
a description which applies to no one on the train said poirot
10the evidence of the italianand now said poirot with a twinkle in his eye we will delight the heart of m bouc and see the italian
antonio foscarelli came into the diningcar with a swift catlike tread
his face beamed
it was a typical italian face sunnylooking and swarthy
he spoke french well and fluently with only a slight accent
your name is antonio foscarelli
yes monsieur
you are i see a naturalised american subject
the american grinned
yes monsieur
it is better for my business
you are an agent for ford motor cars
yes you seea voluble exposition followed
at the end of it anything that the three men did not know about foscarellis business methods his journeys his income and his opinion of the united states and most european countries seemed a negligible factor
this was not a man who had to have information dragged from him
it gushed out
his goodnatured childish face beamed with satisfaction as with a last eloquent gesture he paused and wiped his forehead with a handkerchief
so you see he said
i do big business
i am up to date
i understand salesmanship
you have been in the united states then for the last ten years on and off
yes monsieur
ah
well do i remember the day i first took the boatto go to america so far away
my mother my little sisterpoirot cut short the flood of reminiscence
during your sojourn in the united states did you ever come across the deceased
never
but i know the type
oh
yes
he snapped his fingers expressively
it is very respectable very welldressed but underneath it is all wrong
out of my experience i should say he was the big crook
i give you my opinion for what it is worth
your opinion is quite right said poirot drily
ratchett was cassetti the kidnapper
what did i tell you
i have learned to be very acuteto read the face
it is necessary
only in america do they teach you the proper way to sell
iyou remember the armstrong case
i do not quite remember
the name yes
it was a little girl a baby was it not
yes a very tragic affair
the italian seemed the first person to demur to this view
ah
well these things they happen he said philosophically in a great civilisation such as americapoirot cut him short
did you ever come across any members of the armstrong family
no i do not think so
it is difficult to say
i will give you some figures
last year alone i soldmonsieur pray confine yourself to the point
the italians hands flung themselves out in a gesture of apology
a thousand pardons
tell me if you please your exact movements last night from dinner onwards
with pleasure
i stay here as long as i can
it is more amusing
i talk to the american gentleman at my table
he sells typewriter ribbons
then i go back to my compartment
it is empty
the miserable john bull who shares it with me is away attending to his master
at last he comes backvery long face as usual
he will not talksays yes and no
a miserable race the englishnot sympathetic
he sits in the corner very stiff reading a book then the conductor comes and makes our beds
nos
4 and 5 murmured poirot
exactlythe end compartment
mine is the upper berth
i get up there
i smoke and read
the little englishman has i think the toothache
he gets out a little bottle of stuff that smells very strong
he lies in bed and groans
presently i sleep
whenever i wake i hear him groaning
do you know if he left the carriage at all during the night
i do not think so
that i should hear
the light from the corridorone wakes up automatically thinking it is the customs examination at some frontier
did he ever speak of his master
ever express any animus against him
i tell you he did not speak
he was not sympathetic
a fish
you smoke you saya pipe cigarettes cigar
cigarettes only
poirot proffered one which he accepted
have you ever been to chicago
inquired m bouc
oh
yesa fine citybut i know best new york cleveland detroit
you have been to the states
no
you should go
itpoirot pushed a sheet of paper across to him
if you will sign this and put your permanent address please
the italian wrote with a flourish
then he rose his smile as engaging as ever
that is all
you do not require me further
good day to you messieurs
i wish we could get out of the snow
i have an appointment in milan
he shook his head sadly
i shall lose the business
he departed
poirot looked at his friend
he has been a long time in america said m bouc and he is an italian and italians use the knife
and they are great liars
i do not like italians
ca se voit said poirot with a smile well it may be that you are right but i will point out to you my friend that there is absolutely no evidence against the man
and what about the psychology
do not italians stab
assuredly said poirot
especially in the heat of a quarrel
but thisthis is a different kind of crime
i have the little idea my friend that this is a crime very carefully planned and staged
it is a farsighted longheaded crime
it is nothow shall i express ita latin crime
it is a crime that shows traces of a cool resourceful deliberate braini think an anglosaxon brainhe picked up the last two passports
let us now he said see miss mary debenham
11the evidence of miss debenhamwhen mary debenham entered the diningcar she confirmed poirots previous estimate of her
she was very neatly dressed in a little black suit with a french grey shirt and the smooth waves of her dark head were neat and unruffled
her manner was as calm and unruffled as her hair
she sat down opposite poirot and m bouc and looked at them inquiringly
your name is mary hermione debenham and you are twentysix years of age
began poirot
yes
english
yes
will you be so kind mademoiselle as to write down your permanent address on this piece of paper
she complied
her writing was clear and legible
and now mademoiselle what have you to tell us of the affair last night
i am afraid i have nothing to tell you
i went to bed and slept
does it distress you very much mademoiselle that a crime has been committed on this train
the question was clearly unexpected
her grey eyes widened a little
i dont quite understand you
it was a perfectly simple question that i asked you mademoiselle
i will repeat it
are you very much distressed that a crime should have been committed on this train
i have not really thought about it from that point of view
no i cannot say that i am at all distressed
a crimeit is all in the days work to you eh
it is naturally an unpleasant thing to have happen said mary debenham quietly
you are very anglosaxon mademoiselle
vous neprouvez pas demotion
she smiled a little
i am afraid i cannot have hysterics to prove my sensibility
after all people die every day
they die yes
but murder is a little more rare
oh
certainly
you were not acquainted with the dead man
i saw him for the first time when lunching here yesterday
and how did he strike you
i hardly noticed him
he did not impress you as an evil personality
she shrugged her shoulders slightly
really i cannot say i thought about it
poirot looked at her keenly
you are i think a little bit contemptuous of the way i prosecute my inquiries he said with a twinkle
not so you think would an english inquiry be conducted
there everything would be cut and driedit would be all kept to the factsa wellordered business
but i mademoiselle have my little originalities
i look first at my witness i sum up his or her character and i frame my questions accordingly
just a little minute ago i am asking questions of a gentleman who wants to tell me all his ideas on every subject
well him i keep strictly to the point
i want him to answer yes or no
this or that
and then you come
i see at once that you will be orderly and methodical
you will confine yourself to the matter in hand
your answers will be brief and to the point
and because mademoiselle human nature is perverse i ask of you quite different questions
i ask what you feel what you think
it does not please you this method
if you will forgive my saying so it seems somewhat of a waste of time
whether or not i liked mr ratchetts face does not seem likely to be helpful in finding out who killed him
do you know who the man ratchett really was mademoiselle
she nodded
mrs hubbard has been telling everyone
and what do you think of the armstrong affair
it was quite abominable said the girl crisply
poirot looked at her thoughtfully
you are travelling from baghdad i believe miss debenham
yes
to london
yes
what have you been doing in baghdad
i have been acting as governess to two children
are you returning to your post after your holiday
i am not sure
why is that
baghdad is rather out of things
i think i should prefer a post in london if i can hear of a suitable one
i see
i thought perhaps you might be going to be married
miss debenham did not reply
she raised her eyes and looked poirot full in the face
the glance said plainly you are impertinent
what is your opinion of the lady who shares your compartmentmiss ohlsson
she seems a pleasant simple creature
what colour is her dressinggown
mary debenham stared
a kind of brownish colournatural wool
ah
i may mention without indiscretion i hope that i noticed the colour of your dressinggown on the way from aleppo to stamboul
a pale mauve i believe
yes that is right
have you any other dressinggown mademoiselle
a scarlet dressinggown for example
no that is not mine
poirot leant forward
he was like a cat pouncing on a mouse
whose then
the girl drew back a little startled
i dont know
what do you mean
you do not say no i have no such thing
you say that is not mine
meaning that such a thing does belong to someone else
she nodded
somebody else on this train
yes
whose is it
i told you just now i dont know
i woke up this morning about five oclock with the feeling that the train had been standing still for a long time
i opened the door and looked out into the corridor thinking we might be at a station
i saw someone in a scarlet kimono some way down the corridor
and you dont know who it was
was she fair or dark or greyhaired
i cant say
she had on a shingle cap and i only saw the back of her head
and in build
tallish and slim i should judge but its difficult to say
the kimono was embroidered with dragons
yes yes that is rightdragons
he was silent a minute
he murmured to himself
i cannot understand
i cannot understand
none of this makes sense
then looking up he said i need not keep you further mademoiselle
oh
she seemed rather taken aback but rose promptly
in the doorway however she hesitated a minute and then came back
the swedish ladymiss ohlsson is itseems rather worried
she says you told her she was the last person to see this man alive
she thinks i believe that you suspect her on that account
cant i tell her that she has made a mistake
really you know she is the kind of creature who wouldnt hurt a fly
she smiled a little as she spoke
what time was it that she went to fetch the aspirin from mrs
hubbard
just after halfpast ten
she was awayhow long
about five minutes
did she leave the compartment again during the night
no
poirot turned to the doctor
could ratchett have been killed as early as that
the doctor shook his head
then i think you can reassure your friend mademoiselle
thank you
she smiled suddenly at him a smile that invited sympathy
shes like a sheep you know
she gets anxious and bleats
she turned and went out
12the evidence of the german ladysmaidm bouc was looking at his friend curiously
i do not quite understand you mon vieux
you were trying to dowhat
i was searching for a flaw my friend
a flaw
yesin the armour of a young ladys selfpossession
i wished to shake her sangfroid
did i succeed
i do not know
but i know this she did not expect me to tackle the matter as i did
you suspect her said m bow slowly
but why
she seems a very charming young ladythe last person in the world to be mixed up in a crime of this kind
i agree said constantine
she is cold
she has not emotions
she would not stab a manshe would sue him in the law courts
poirot sighed
you must both of you get rid of your obsession that this is an unpremeditated and sudden crime
as for the reasons why i suspect miss debenham there are two
one is because of something that i overheard and that you do not as yet know
he retailed to them the curious interchange of phrases he had overheard on the journey from aleppo
that is curious certainly said m bouc when he had finished
it needs explaining
if it means what you suspect it means then they are both of them in it togethershe and the stiff englishman
poirot nodded
and that is just what is not borne out by the facts he said
see you if they were both in this together what should we expect to find
that each of them would provide an alibi for the other
is not that so
but nothat does not happen
miss debenhams alibi is provided by a swedish woman whom she has never seen before and colonel arbuthnots alibi is vouched for by macqueen the dead mans secretary
no that solution of the puzzle is too easy
you said there was another reason for your suspicions of her m bouc reminded him
poirot smiled
ah
but that is only psychological
i ask myself is it possible for miss debenham to have planned this crime
behind this business i am convinced there is a cool intelligent resourceful brain
miss debenham answers to that description
m bouc shook his head
i think you are wrong my friend
i do not see that young english girl as a criminal
ah
well said poirot picking up the last passport
to the final name on our list
hildegarde schmidt ladysmaid
summoned by the attendant hildegarde schmidt came into the restaurant car and stood waiting respectfully
poirot motioned her to sit down
she did so folding her hands and waiting placidly till he questioned her
she seemed a placid creature altogethereminently respectable perhaps not overintelligent
poirots methods with hildegarde schmidt were a complete contrast to his handling of mary debenham
he was at his kindest and most genial setting the woman at her ease
then having got her to write down her name and address he slid gently into his questions
the interview took place in german
we want to know as much as possible about what happened last night he said
we know that you cannot give us much information bearing on the crime itself but you may have seen or heard something that while conveying nothing to you may be valuable to us
you understand
she did not seem to
her broad kindly face remained set in its expression of placid stupidity as she answeredi do not know anything monsieur
well for instance you know that your mistress sent for you last night
that yes
do you remember the time
i do not monsieur
i was asleep you see when the attendant came and told me
yes yes
was it usual for you to be sent for in this way
it was not unusual monsieur
the gracious lady often required attention at night
she did not sleep well
eh bien then you received the summons and you got up
did you put on a dressinggown
no monsieur i put on a few clothes
i would not like to go in to her excellency in my dressinggown
and yet it is a very nice dressinggownscarlet is it not
she stared at him
it is a dark blue flannel dressinggown monsieur
ah
continue
a little pleasantry on my part that is all
so you went along to madame la princesse
and what did you do when you got there
i gave her massage monsieur and then i read aloud
i do not read aloud very well but her excellency says that is all the betterso it sends her better to sleep
when she became sleepy monsieur she told me to go so i closed the book and i returned to my own compartment
do you know what time that was
no monsieur
well how long had you been with madame la princesse
about half an hour monsieur
good continue
first i fetched her excellency an extra rug from my compartment
it was very cold in spite of the heating
i arranged the rug over her and she wished me good night
i poured her out some mineral water
then i turned out the light and left her
and then
there is nothing more monsieur
i returned to my carriage and went to sleep
and you met no one in the corridor
no monsieur
you did not for instance see a lady in a scarlet kimono with dragons on it
her mild eyes bulged at him
no indeed monsieur
there was nobody about except the attendant
everyone was asleep
but you did see the conductor
yes monsieur
what was he doing
he came out of one of the compartments monsieur
what
m bouc leaned forward
which one
hildegarde schmidt looked frightened again and poirot cast a reproachful glance at his friend
naturally he said
the conductor often has to answer bells at night
do you remember which compartment it was
it was about the middle of the coach monsieur
two or three doors from madame la princesse
ah
tell us if you please exactly where this was and what happened
he nearly ran into me monsieur
it was when i was returning from my compartment to that of the princess with the rug
and he came out of a compartment and almost collided with you
in which direction was he going
towards me monsieur
he apologised and passed on down the corridor towards the diningcar
a bell began ringing but i do not think he answered it
she paused and then said i do not understand
how is itpoirot spoke reassuringly
it is just a question of time he said
all a matter of routine
this poor conductor he seems to have had a busy nightfirst waking you and then answering bells
it was not the same conductor who woke me monsieur
it was another one
ah
another one
had you seen him before
no monsieur
ahdo you think you would recognise him if you saw him
i think so monsieur
poirot murmured something in m boucs ear
the latter got up and went to the door to give an order
poirot was continuing his questions in an easy friendly manner
have you ever been to america fraulein schmidt
never monsieur
it must be a fine country
you have heard perhaps who this man who was killed really wasthat he was responsible for the death of a little child
yes i have heard monsieur
it was abominablewicked
the good god should not allow such things
we are not so wicked as that in germany
tears had come into the womans eyes
her strong motherly soul was moved
it was an abominable crime said poirot gravely
he drew a scrap of cambric from his pocket and handed it to her
is this your handkerchief fraulein schmidt
there was a moments silence as the woman examined it
she looked up after a minute
the colour had mounted a little in her face
ah
no indeed
it is not mine monsieur
it has the initial h you see
that is why i thought it was yours
ah
monsieur it is a ladys handkerchief that
a very expensive handkerchief
embroidered by hand
it comes from paris i should say
it is not yours and you do not know whose it is
i
oh
no monsieur
of the three listening only poirot caught the nuance of hesitation in the reply
m bouc whispered in his ear
poirot nodded and said to the womanthe three sleepingcar attendants are coming in
will you be so kind as to tell me which is the one you met last night as you were going with the rug to the princess
the three men entered
pierre michel the big blond conductor of the athensparis coach and the stout burly conductor of the bucharest one
hildegarde schmidt looked at them and immediately shook her head
no monsieur she said
none of these is the man i saw last night
but these are the only conductors on the train
you must be mistaken
i am quite sure monsieur
these are all tall big men
the one i saw was small and dark
he had a little moustache
his voice when he said pardon was weak like a womans
indeed i remember him very well monsieur
13summary of the passengers evidencea small dark man with a womanish voice said m bouc
the three conductors and hildegarde schmidt had been dismissed
m bouc made a despairing gesture
but i understand nothingbut nothing of all of this
the enemy that this ratchett spoke of he was then on the train after all
but where is he now
how can he have vanished into thin air
my head it whirls
say something then my friend i implore you
show me how the impossible can be possible
it is a good phrase that said poirot
the impossible cannot have happened therefore the impossible must be possible in spite of appearances
explain to me then quickly what actually happened on the train last night
i am not a magician mon cher
i am like you a very puzzled man
this affair advances in a very strange manner
it does not advance at all
it stays where it was
poirot shook his head
no that is not true
we are more advanced
we know certain things
we have heard the evidence of the passengers
and what has that told us
nothing at all
i would not say that my friend
i exaggerate perhaps
the american hardman and the german maidyes they have added something to our knowledge
that is to say they have made the whole business more unintelligible than it was
no no no said poirot soothingly
m bouc turned upon him
speak then let us hear the wisdom of hercule poirot
did i not tell you that i was like you a very puzzled man
but at least we can face our problem
we can arrange such facts as we have with order and method
pray continue monsieur said dr constantine
poirot cleared his throat and straightened a piece of blottingpaper
let us review the case as it stands at this moment
first there are certain indisputable facts
this man ratchett or cassetti was stabbed in twelve places and died last night
that is fact one
i grant it youi grant it mon vieux said m bouc with a gesture of irony
hercule poirot was not at all put out
he continued calmly
i will pass over for the moment certain rather peculiar appearances which dr constantine and i have already discussed together
i will come to them presently
the next fact of importance to my mind is the time of the crime
that again is one of the few things we do know said m bouc
the crime was committed at a quarter past one this morning
everything goes to show that that was so
not everything
you exaggerate
there is certainly a fair amount of evidence to support that view
i am glad you admit that at least
poirot went on calmly unperturbed by the interruption
we have before us three possibilities
1that the crime was committed as you say at a quarter past one
this is supported by the evidence of the watch by the evidence of mrs hubbard and by the evidence of the german woman hildegarde schmidt
it agrees with the evidence of dr constantine
2that the crime was committed later and that the evidence of the watch was deliberately faked in order to mislead
3that the crime was committed earlier and the evidence faked for the same reason as above
now if we accept possibility 1 as the most likely to have occurred and the one supported by most evidence we must also accept certain facts arising from it
if the crime was committed at a quarter past one the murderer cannot have left the train and the questions arise where is he
and who is he
to begin with let us examine the evidence carefully
we first hear of the existence of this manthe small dark man with a womanish voicefrom the man hardman
he says that ratchett told him of this person and employed him to watch out for the man
there is no evidence to support this we have only hardmans word for it
let us next examine the question is hardman the person he pretends to be an operative of a new york detective agency
what to my mind is so interesting in this case is that we have none of the facilities afforded to the police
we cannot investigate the bona fides of any of these people
we have to rely solely on deduction
that to me makes the matter very much more interesting
there is no routine work
it is all a matter of the intellect
i ask myself can we accept hardmans account of himself
i make my decision and i answer yes
i am of the opinion that we can accept hardmans account of himself
you rely on the intuition
what the americans call the hunch
asked dr constantine
not at all
i regard the probabilities
hardman is travelling with a false passportthat will at once make him an object of suspicion
the first thing that the police will do when they do arrive upon the scene is to detain hardman and cable as to whether his account of himself is true
in the case of many of the passengers to establish their bona fides will be difficult in most cases it will probably not be attempted especially since there seems nothing in the way of suspicion attaching to them
but in hardmans case it is simple
either he is the person he represents himself to be or he is not
therefore i say that all will prove to be in order
you acquit him of suspicion
not at all
you misunderstand me
for all i know any american detective might have his own private reasons for wishing to murder ratchett
no what i am saying is that i think we can accept hardmans own account of himself
this story then that he tells of ratchetts seeking him out and employing him is not unlikely and is most probablythough not of course certainlytrue
if we are going to accept it as true we must see if there is any confirmation of it
we find it in rather an unlikely placein the evidence of hildegarde schmidt
her description of the man she saw in wagon lit uniform tallies exactly
is there any further confirmation of these two stories
there is
there is the button that mrs hubbard found in her compartment
and there is also another corroborating statement which you may not have noticed
what is that
the fact that both colonel arbuthnot and hector macqueen mention that the conductor passed their carriage
they attached no importance to the fact but messieurs pierre michel has declared that he did not leave his seat except on certain specified occasionsnone of which would take him down to the far end of the coach past the compartment in which arbuthnot and macqueen were sitting
therefore this story the story of a small dark man with a womanish voice dressed in wagon lit uniform rests on the testimony direct or indirect of four witnesses
one small point said dr constantine
if hildegarde schmidts story is true how is it that the real conductor did not mention having seen her when he came to answer mrs hubbards bell
that is explained i think
when he arrived to answer mrs hubbard the maid was in with her mistress
when she finally returned to her own compartment the conductor was in with mrs
hubbard
m bouc had been waiting with difficulty until they had finished
yes yes my friend he said impatiently to poirot
but whilst i admire your caution your method of advancing a step at a time i submit that you have not yet touched the point at issue
we are all agreed that this person exists
the point is where did he go
poirot shook his head reprovingly
you are in error
you are inclined to put the cart before the horse
before i ask myself where did this man vanish to
i ask myself did such a man really exist
because you see if the man were an inventiona fabricationhow much easier to make him disappear
so i try to establish first that there really is such a fleshandblood person
and having arrived at the fact that there iseh bien where is he now
there are only two answers to that mon cher
either he is still hidden on the train in a place of such extraordinary ingenuity that we cannot even think of it or else he is as one might say two persons
that is he is both himselfthe man feared by m ratchettand a passenger on the train so well disguised that m ratchett did not recognise him
it is an idea that said m bouc his face lighting up
then it clouded over again
but there is one objectionpoirot took the words out of his mouth
the height of the man
it is that you would say
with the exception of mr ratchetts valet all the passengers are big menthe italian colonel arbuthnot hector macqueen count andrenyi
well that leaves us the valetnot a very likely supposition
but there is another possibility
remember the womanish voice
that gives us a choice of alternatives
the man may be disguised as a woman or alternatively he may actually be a woman
a tall woman dressed in mens clothes would look small
but surely ratchett would have knownperhaps he did know
perhaps already this woman had attempted his life wearing a mares clothes the better to accomplish her purpose
ratchett may have guessed that she would use the same trick again so he tells hardman to look for a man
but he mentions however a womanish voice
it is a possibility said m bouc
butlisten my friend i think that i should now tell you of certain inconsistencies noticed by dr
constantine
he retailed at length the conclusions that he and the doctor had arrived at together from the nature of the dead mans wounds
m bouc groaned and held his head again
i know said poirot sympathetically
i know exactly how you feel
the head spins does it not
the whole thing is a fantasy
cried m bouc
exactly
it is absurdimprobableit cannot be
so i myself have said
and yet my friend there it is
one cannot escape from the facts
it is madness
is it not
it is so mad my friend that sometimes i am haunted by the sensation that really it must be very simple

but that is only one of my little ideas
two murderers groaned m bouc
and on the orient expressthe thought almost made him weep
and now let us make the fantasy more fantastic said poirot cheerfully
last night on the train there are two mysterious strangers
there is the wagon lit attendant answering to the description given us by m hardman and seen by hildegarde schmidt colonel arbuthnot and m macqueen
there is also a woman in a red kimonoa tall slim woman seen by pierre michel miss debenham m macqueen and myself and smelt i may say by colonel arbuthnot
who was she
no one on the train admits to having a scarlet kimono
she too has vanished
was she one and the same with the spurious wagon lit attendant
or was she some quite distinct personality
where are they these two
and incidentally where are the wagon lit uniform and the scarlet kimono
ah
that is something definite
m bouc sprang up eagerly
we must search all the passengers luggage
yes that will be something
poirot rose also
i will make a prophecy he said
you know where they are
i have a little idea
where then
you will find the scarlet kimono in the baggage of one of the men and you will find the uniform of the wagon lit conductor in the baggage of hildegarde schmidt
hildegarde schmidt
you thinknot what you are thinking
i will put it like this
if hildegarde schmidt is guilty the uniform may be found in her baggage
but if she is innocent it certainly will be
but how began m bouc and stopped
what is this noise that approaches
he cried
it resembles a locomotive in motion
the noise drew nearer
it consisted of shrill cries and protests in a womans voice
the door at the end of the diningcar burst open
mrs hubbard burst in
its too horrible
she cried
its just too horrible
in my spongebag
my spongebag
a great knifeall over blood
and suddenly toppling forward she fainted heavily on m boucs shoulder
14the evidence of the weaponwith more vigour than chivalry a bouc deposited the fainting lady with her head on the table
dr constantine yelled for one of the restaurant attendants who came at a run
keep her head so said the doctor
if she revives give her a little cognac
you understand
then he hurried off after the other two
his interest lay wholly in the crimeswooning middleaged ladies did not interest him at all
it is possible that mrs hubbard revived rather more quickly by these methods than she might otherwise have done
a few minutes later she was sitting up sipping cognac from a glass proffered by the attendant and talking once more
i just cant tell you how terrible it was
i dont suppose anybody on this train can understand my feelings
ive always been very very sensitive ever since i was a child
the mere sight of bloodugh
why even now i get faint when i think about it
the attendant proffered the glass again
encore un peu madame
dyou think id better
im a lifelong teetotaller
i never touch spirits or wine at any time
all my family are abstainers
still perhaps as this is only medicinalshe sipped once more
in the meantime poirot and m bouc closely followed by dr constantine had hurried out of the restaurant car and along the corridor of the stamboul coach towards mrs hubbards compartment
every traveller on the train seemed to be congregated outside the door
the conductor a harassed look on his face was keeping them back
mais il ny a rien a voir he said and repeated the sentiment in several other languages
let me pass if you please said m bouc
squeezing his rotundity past the obstructing passengers he entered the compartment poirot close behind him
i am glad you have come monsieur said the conductor with a sigh of relief
everyone has been trying to enter
the american ladysuch screams as she gavema foi i thought she too had been murdered
i came at a run and there she was screaming like a mad woman and she cried out that she must fetch you and she departed screeching at the top of her voice and telling everybody whose carriage she passed what had occurred
he added with a gesture of the hand it is in there monsieur
i have not touched it
hanging on the handle of the door that gave access to the next compartment was a largechecked rubber spongebag
below it on the floor just where it had fallen from mrs hubbards hand was a straightbladed daggera cheap affair sham oriental with an embossed hilt and a tapering blade
the blade was stained with patches of what looked like rust
poirot picked it up delicately
yes he murmured
there is no mistake
here is our missing weapon all righteh doctor
the doctor examined it
you need not be so careful said poirot
there will be no fingerprints on it save those of mrs
hubbard
constantines examination did not take long
it is the weapon all right he said
it would account for any of the wounds
i implore you my friend do not say that
the doctor looked astonished
already we are heavily overburdened by coincidence
two people decided to stab m ratchett last night
it is too much of a good thing that both of them should select the same weapon
as to that the coincidence is not perhaps so great as it seems said the doctor
thousands of these sham eastern daggers are made and shipped to the bazaars of constantinople
you console me a little but only a little said poirot
he looked thoughtfully at the door in front of him then lifting off the spongebag he tried the handle
the door did not budge
about a foot above the handle was the door bolt
poirot drew it back and tried again but still the door remained fast
we locked it from the other side you remember said the doctor
that is true said poirot absently
he seemed to be thinking about something else
his brow was furrowed as though in perplexity
it agrees does it not
said m bouc
the man passes through this carriage
as he shuts the communicating door behind him he feels the spongebag
a thought comes to him and he quickly slips the bloodstained knife inside
then all unwitting that he has awakened mrs hubbard he slips out through the other door into the corridor
as you say murmured poirot
that is how it must have happened
but the puzzled look did not leave his face
but what is it
demanded m bouc
there is something is there not that does not satisfy you
poirot darted a quick took at him
the same point does not strike you
no evidently not
well it is a small matter
the conductor looked into the carriage
the american lady is coming back
dr constantine looked rather guilty
he had he felt treated mrs hubbard rather cavalierly
but she had no reproaches for him
her energies were concentrated on another matter
im going to say one thing right out she said breathlessly as she arrived in the doorway
im not going on any longer in this compartment
why i wouldnt sleep in it tonight if you paid me a million dollars
but madamei know what you are going to say and im telling you right now that i wont do any such thing
why id rather sit up all night in the corridor
she began to cry
oh if my daughter could only knowif she could see me now whypoirot interrupted firmly
you misunderstand madame
your demand is most reasonable
your baggage shall be changed at once to another compartment
mrs hubbard lowered her handkerchief
is that so
oh
i feel better right away
but surely its all full unless one of the gentlemenm bouc spoke
your baggage madame shall be moved out of this coach altogether
you shall have a compartment in the next coach which was put on at belgrade
why thats splendid
im not an extra nervous woman but to sleep in that compartment next door to a dead man
she shivered
it would drive me plumb crazy
michel called m bouc
move this baggage into a vacant compartment in the athensparis coach
yes monsieur
the same one as thisthe no
3
no said poirot before his friend could reply
i think it would be better for madame to have a different number altogether
the no
12 for instance
bien monsieur
the conductor seized the luggage
mrs hubbard turned gratefully to poirot
thats very kind and delicate of you
i appreciate it i assure you
do not mention it madame
we will come with you and see you comfortably installed
mrs hubbard was escorted by the three men to her new home
she looked round her happily
this is fine
it suits you madame
it is you see exactly like the compartment you have left
thats soonly it faces the other way
but that doesnt matter for these trains go first one way and then the other
i said to my daughter i want a carriage facing the engine
and she said why mamma thatll be no good to you for if you go to sleep one way when you wake up the trains going the other
and it was quite true what she said
why last evening we went into belgrade one way and out the other
at any rate madame you are quite happy and contented now
well no i wouldnt say that
here we are stuck in a snowdrift and nobody doing anything about it and my boat sailing the day after tomorrow
madame said m bouc we are all in the same caseevery one of us
well thats true admitted mrs hubbard
but nobody else has had a murderer walking right through her compartment in the middle of the night
what still puzzles me madame said poirot is how the man got into your compartment if the communicating door was bolted as you say
you are sure that it was bolted
why the swedish lady tried it before my eyes
let us just reconstruct that little scene
you were lying in your bunksoand you could not see for yourself you say
no because of the spongebag
oh
my i shall have to get a new spongebag
it makes me feel sick at my stomach to look at this one
poirot picked up the spongebag and hung it on the handle of the communicating door into the next carriage
precisement
i see he said
the bolt is just underneath the handlethe spongebag masks it
you could not see from where you were lying whether the bolt was turned or not
why thats just what ive been telling you
and the swedish lady miss ohlsson stood so between you and the door
she tried it and told you it was bolted
thats so
all the same madame she may have made an error
you see what i mean
poirot seemed anxious to explain
the bolt is just a projection of metalso
when it is turned to the right the door is locked
when it is left straight the door is unlocked
possibly she merely tried the door and as it was locked on the other side she may have assumed that it was locked on your side
well i guess that would be rather stupid of her
madame the most kind the most amiable are not always the cleverest
thats so of course
by the way madame did you travel out to smyrna this way
no
i sailed right to stamboul and a friend of my daughters mr johnson a perfectly lovely man id like to have you know him met me and showed me all round stamboul
but it was a very disappointing cityall tumbling down and as for those mosques and putting on those great shuffling things over your shoeswhere was i
you were saying that mr johnson met you
thats so and he saw me on board a french messageries boat for smyrna and my daughters husband was waiting right on the quay
what hell say when he hears about all this
my daughter said this would be just the safest easiest way imaginable
you just sit in your carriage she said and you land right in parrus and there the american express will meet you
and oh dear what am i to do about cancelling my steamship passage
i ought to let them know
i cant possibly make it now
this is just too terriblemrs hubbard showed signs of tears once more
poirot who had been fidgeting slightly seized his opportunity
you have had a shock madame
the restaurant attendant shall be instructed to bring you along some tea and some biscuits
i dont know that im so set on tea said mrs hubbard tearfully
thats more an english habit
coffee then madame
you need some stimulantthat cognacs made my head feel mighty funny
i think i would like some coffee
excellent
you must revive your forces
my what a funny expression
but first madame a little matter of routine
you permit that i make a search of your baggage
what for
we are about to commence a search of all the passengers luggage
i do not want to remind you of an unpleasant experience but your spongebagremember
mercy
perhaps youd better
i just couldnt bear to get any more surprises of that kind
the examination was quickly over
mrs hubbard was travelling with the minimum of luggagea hatbox a cheap suitcase and a wellburdened travelling bag
the contents of all three were simple and straightforward and the examination would not have taken more than a couple of minutes had not mrs hubbard delayed matters by insisting on due attention being paid to photographs of my daughter and of two rather ugly childrenmy daughters children
arent they cunning
15the evidence of the passengers luggagehaving delivered himself of various polite insincerities and having told mrs hubbard that he would order coffee to be brought to her poirot was able to take his leave accompanied by his two friends
well we have made a start and drawn a blank observed m bouc
whom shall we attack next
it would be simplest i think just to proceed along the train carriage by carriage
that means that we start with no
16the amiable mr
hardman
mr hardman who was smoking a cigar welcomed them affably
come right in gentlemen
that is if its humanly possible
its just a mite cramped in here for a party
m bouc explained the object of their visit and the big detective nodded comprehendingly
thats ok
to tell the truth ive been wondering you didnt get down to it sooner
here are my keys gentlemen and if you like to search my pockets too why youre welcome
shall i reach the grips down for you
the conductor will do that
michel
the contents of mr hardmans two grips were soon examined and passed
they contained perhaps an undue proportion of spirituous liquor
mr hardman winked
its not often they search your grips at the frontiersnot if you fix the conductor
i handed out a wad of turkish notes right away and theres been no trouble so far
and at paris
mr hardman winked again
by the time i get to paris he said whats left over of this little lot will go into a bottle labelled hairwash
you are not a believer in prohibition monsieur hardman said m bouc with a smile
well said hardman i cant say prohibition has ever worried me any
ah
said m bouc
the speakeasy
he pronounced the word with care savouring it
your american terms are so quaint so expressive he said
me i would much like to go to america said poirot
youd learn a few goahead methods over there said hardman
europe needs waking up
shes half asleep
it is true that america is the country of progress agreed poirot
there is much that i admire about americans
onlyi am perhaps oldfashionedbut me i find the american women less charming than my own countrywomen
the french or the belgian girl coquettish charmingi think there is no one to touch her
hardman turned away to peer out at the snow for a minute
perhaps youre right m poirot he said
but i guess every nation likes its own girls best
he blinked as though the snow hurt his eyes
kind of dazzling isnt it
he remarked
say gentlemen this business is getting on my nerves
murder and the snow and all
and nothing doing
just hanging about and killing time
id like to get busy after someone or something
the true western spirit of hustle said poirot with a smile
the conductor replaced the bags and they moved on to the next compartment
colonel arbuthnot was sitting in a corner smoking a pipe and reading a magazine
poirot explained their errand
the colonel made no demur
he had two heavy leather suitcases
the rest of my kit has gone by long sea he explained
like most army men the colonel was a neat packer
the examination of his baggage took only a few minutes
poirot noted a packet of pipecleaners
you always use the same kind
he asked
usually
if i can get em
ah
poirot nodded
these pipecleaners corresponded exactly with the one he had found on the floor of the dead mans compartment
dr constantine remarked as much when they were out in the corridor again
tout de meme murmured poirot i can hardly believe it
it is not dans son caractere and when you have said that you have said everything
the door of the next compartment was closed
it was that occupied by princess dragomiroff
they knocked on the door and the princesss deep voice called entrez
m bouc was spokesman
he was very deferential and polite as he explained their errand
the princess listened to him in silence her small toadlike face quite impassive
if it is necessary messieurs she said quietly when he had finished that is all there is to it
my maid has the keys
she will attend to it with you
does your maid always carry your keys madame
asked poirot
certainly monsieur
and if during the night at one of the frontiers the customs officials should require a piece of luggage to be opened
the old lady shrugged her shoulders
it is very unlikely
but in such a case the conductor would fetch her
you trust her then implicitly madame
i have told you so already said the princess quietly
i do not employ people whom i do not trust
yes said poirot thoughtfully
trust is indeed something in these days
it is perhaps better to have a homely woman whom one can trust than a more chic maidfor example some smart parisienne
he saw the dark intelligent eyes come slowly round and fasten themselves upon his face
what exactly are you implying m
poirot
nothing madame
i
nothing
but yes
you think do you not that i should have a smart frenchwoman to attend to my toilet
it would be perhaps more usual madame
she shook her head
schmidt is devoted to me
her voice dwelt lingeringly on the words
devotioncest impayable
the german woman had arrived with the keys
the princess spoke to her in her own language telling her to open the valises and help the gentlemen in their search
she herself remained in the corridor looking out at the snow and poirot remained with her leaving m bouc to the task of searching the luggage
she regarded him with a grim smile
well monsieur do you not wish to see what my valises contain
he shook his head
madame it is a formality that is all
are you so sure
in your case yes
and yet i knew and loved sonia armstrong
what do you think then
that i would not soil my hands with killing such canaille as that man cassetti
well perhaps you are right
she was silent a minute or two
then she saidwith such a man as that do you know what i should have liked to do
i should have liked to call to my servants flog this man to death and fling him out on the rubbish heap
that is the way things were done when i was young monsieur
still he did not speak just listened attentively
she looked at him with a sudden impetuosity
you do not say anything m poirot
what is it that you are thinking i wonder
he looked at her with a very direct glance
i think madame that your strength is in your willnot in your arm
she glanced down at her thin blackclad arms ending in those clawlike yellow hands with the rings on the fingers
it is true she said
i have no strength in thesenone
i do not know whether i am sorry or glad
then she turned abruptly back towards her carriage where the maid was busily packing up the cases
the princess cut short m boucs apologies
there is no need for you to apologise monsieur she said
a murder has been committed
certain actions have to be performed
that is all there is to it
vous etes bien aimable madame
she inclined her head slightly as they departed
the doors of the next two carriages were shut
m bouc paused and scratched his head
diable
he said
this may be awkward
these are diplomatic passports
their luggage is exempt
from customs examination yes
but a murder is different
i know
all the samewe do not want to have complications
do not distress yourself my friend
the count and countess will be reasonable
see how amiable princess dragomiroff was about it
she is truly grande dame
these two are also of the same position but the count impressed me as a man of somewhat truculent disposition
he was not pleased when you insisted on questioning his wife
and this will annoy him still further
supposeehwe omit them
after all they can have nothing to do with the matter
why should i stir up needless trouble for myself
i do not agree with you said poirot
i feel sure that count andrenyi will be reasonable
at any rate let us make the attempt
and before m bouc could reply he rapped sharply on the door of no
13
a voice from within cried entrez
the count was sitting in the corner near the door reading a newspaper
the countess was curled up in the opposite corner near the window
there was a pillow behind her head and she seemed to have been asleep
pardon monsieur le comte began poirot
pray forgive this intrusion
it is that we are making a search of all the baggage on the train
in most cases a mere formality
but it has to be done
m bouc suggests that as you have a diplomatic passport you might reasonably claim to be exempt from such a search
the count considered for a moment
thank you he said
but i do not think that i care to have an exception made in my case
i should prefer that our baggage should be examined like that of the other passengers
he turned to his wife
you do not object i hope elena
not at all said the countess without hesitation
a rapid and somewhat perfunctory search followed
poirot seemed to be trying to mask an embarrassment by making various small pointless remarks such ashere is a label all wet on your suitcase madame as he lifted down a blue morocco case with initials on it and a coronet
the countess did not reply to this observation
she seemed indeed rather bored by the whole proceeding remaining curled up in her corner and staring dreamily out through the window whilst the men searched her luggage in the compartment next door
poirot finished his search by opening the little cupboard above the washbasin and taking a rapid glance at its contentsa sponge face cream powder and a small bottle labelled trional
then with polite remarks on either side the search party withdrew
mrs hubbards compartment that of the dead man and poirots own came next
they now came to the secondclass carriages
the first one nos
10 and 11 was occupied by mary debenham who was reading a book and greta ohlsson who was fast asleep but woke with a start at their entrance
poirot repeated his formula
the swedish lady seemed agitated mary debenham calmly indifferent
he addressed himself to the swedish lady
if you permit mademoiselle we will examine your baggage first and then perhaps you would be so good as to see how the american lady is getting on
we have moved her into one of the carriages in the next coach but she is still very much upset as the result of her discovery
i have ordered coffee to be sent to her but i think she is of those to whom someone to talk to is a necessity of the first order
the good lady was instantly sympathetic
she would go immediately
it must have been indeed a terrible shock to the nerves and already the poor lady was upset by the journey and leaving her daughter
ah yes certainly she would go at onceher case was not lockedand she would take with her some sal ammoniac
she bustled off
her possessions were soon examined
they were meagre in the extreme
she had evidently not yet noticed the missing wires from the hatbox
miss debenham had put her book down
she was watching poirot
when he asked her she handed over her keys
then as he lifted down a case and opened it she saidwhy did you send her away m
poirot
i mademoiselle
why to minister to the american lady
an excellent pretextbut a pretext all the same
i dont understand you mademoiselle
i think you understand me very well
she smiled
you wanted to get me alone
wasnt that it
you are putting words into my mouth mademoiselle
and ideas into your head
no i dont think so
the ideas are already there
that is right isnt it
mademoiselle we have a proverbqui sexcuse saccuseis that what you were going to say
you must give me the credit for a certain amount of observation and common sense
for some reason or other you have got it into your head that i know something about this sordid businessthis murder of a man i never saw before
you are imagining things mademoiselle
no i am not imagining things at all
but it seems to me that a lot of time is wasted by not speaking the truthby beating about the bush instead of coming straight out with things
and you do not like the waste of time
no you like to come straight to the point
you like the direct method
eh bien i will give it to you the direct method
i will ask you the meaning of certain words that i overheard on the journey from syria
i had got out of the train to do what the english call stretch the legs at the station of konya
your voice and the colonels mademoiselle they came to me out of the night
you said to him not now
not now
when its all over
when its behind us
what did you mean by those words mademoiselle
she asked very quietly do you think i meantmurder
it is i who am asking you mademoiselle
she sighedwas lost a minute in thought
then as though rousing herself she saidthose words had a meaning monsieur but not one that i can tell you
i can only give you my solemn word of honour that i had never set eyes on this man ratchett in my life until i saw him on this train
andyou refuse to explain those words
yes if you like to put it that wayi refuse
they had to do withwith a task i had undertaken
a task that is now ended
what do you mean
it is ended is it not
why should you think so
listen mademoiselle i will recall to you another incident
there was a delay to the train on the day we were to reach stamboul
you were very agitated mademoiselle
you so calm so selfcontrolled
you lost that calm
i did not want to miss my connection
so you said
but mademoiselle the orient express leaves stamboul every day of the week
even if you had missed the connection it would only have been a matter of twentyfour hours delay
miss debenham for the first time showed signs of losing her temper
you do not seem to realise that one may have friends awaiting ones arrival in london and that a days delay upsets arrangements and causes a lot of annoyance
ah it is like that
there are friends awaiting your arrival
you do not want to cause them inconvenience
naturally
and yetit is curiouswhat is curious
on this trainagain we have a delay
and this time a more serious delay since there is no possibility of sending a telegram to your friends or of getting them on the longthe longlong distance
the telephone you mean
ah yes the portmanteau call as you say in england
mary debenham smiled a little in spite of herself
trunk call she corrected
yes as you say it is extremely annoying not to be able to get any word through either by telephone or by telegraph
and yet mademoiselle this time your manner is quite different
you no longer betray the impatience
you are calm and philosophical
mary debenham flushed and bit her lip
she no longer felt inclined to smile
you do not answer mademoiselle
i am sorry
i did not know that there was anything to answer
your change of attitude mademoiselle
dont you think that you are making rather a fuss about nothing m
poirot
poirot spread out his hands in an apologetic gesture
it is perhaps a fault with us detectives
we expect the behaviour to be always consistent
we do not allow for changes of mood
mary debenham made no reply
you know colonel arbuthnot well mademoiselle
he fancied that she was relieved by the change of subject
i met him for the first time on this journey
have you any reason to suspect that he may have known this man ratchett
she shook her head decisively
i am quite sure he didnt
why are you sure
by the way he spoke
and yet mademoiselle we found a pipecleaner on the floor of the dead mans compartment
and colonel arbuthnot is the only man on the train who smokes a pipe
he watched her narrowly but she displayed neither surprise nor emotion merely saidnonsense
its absurd
colonel arbuthnot is the last man in the world to be mixed up in a crimeespecially a theatrical kind of crime like this
it was so much what poirot himself thought that he found himself on the point of agreeing with her
he said insteadi must remind you that you do not know him very well mademoiselle
she shrugged her shoulders
i know the type well enough
he said very gentlyyou still refuse to tell me the meaning of those words when its behind us
she replied coldly i have nothing more to say
it does not matter said hercule poirot
i shall find out
he bowed and left the compartment closing the door after him
was that wise my friend
asked m bouc
you have put her on her guardand through her you have put the colonel on his guard also
mon ami if you wish to catch a rabbit you put a ferret into the hole and if the rabbit is therehe runs
that is all i have done
they entered the compartment of hildegarde schmidt
the woman was standing in readiness her face respectful but unemotional
poirot took a quick glance through the contents of the small case on the seat
then he motioned to the attendant to get down the bigger suitcase from the rack
the keys
he said
it is not locked monsieur
poirot undid the hasps and lifted the lid
aha
he said and turning to m bouc you remember what i said
look here a little moment
on the top of the suitcase was a hastily rolledup brown wagon lit uniform
the stolidity of the german woman underwent a sudden change
ach
she cried
that is not mine
i did not put it there
i have never looked in that case since we left stamboul
indeed indeed it is true
she looked from one to another of the men pleadingly
poirot took her gently by the arm and soothed her
no no all is well
we believe you
do not be agitated
i am sure you did not hide the uniform there as i am sure that you are a good cook
see
you are a good cook are you not
bewildered the woman smiled in spite of herself yes indeed all my ladies have said so
ishe stopped her mouth open looking frightened again
no no said poirot
i assure you all is well
see i will tell you how this happened
this man the man you saw in wagon lit uniform comes out of the dead mans compartment
he collides with you
that is bad luck for him
he has hoped that no one will see him
what to do next
he must get rid of his uniform
it is now not a safeguard but a danger
his glance went to m bow and dr constantine who were listening attentively
there is the snow you see
the snow which confuses all his plans
where can he hide these clothes
all the compartments are full
no he passes one whose door is open showing it to be unoccupied
it must be the one belonging to the woman with whom he has just collided
he slips in removes the uniform and jams it hurriedly into a suitcase on the rack
it may be some time before it is discovered
and then
said m bouc
that we must discuss poirot said with a warning glance
he held up the tunic
a button the third down was missing
poirot slipped his hand into the pocket and took out a conductors passkey used to unlock the doors of the compartments
here is the explanation of how one man was able to pass through locked doors said m bouc
your questions to mrs hubbard were unnecessary
locked or not locked the man could easily get through the communicating door
after all if a wagon lit uniform why not a wagon lit key
why not indeed
returned poirot
we might have known it really
you remember that michel said that the door into the corridor of mrs hubbards compartment was locked when he came in answer to her bell
that is so monsieur said the conductor
that is why i thought the lady must have been dreaming
but now it is easy continued m bouc
doubtless he meant to relock the communicating door also but perhaps he heard some movement from the bed and it startled him
we have now said poirot only to find the scarlet kimono
true
and these last two compartments are occupied by men
we will search all the same
oh
assuredly
besides i remember what you said
hector macqueen acquiesced willingly in the search
id just as soon you did he said with a rueful smile
i feel im definitely the most suspicious character on the train
youve only got to find a will in which the old man left me all his money and thatll just about fix things
m bouc bent a suspicious glance upon him
thats only my fun added macqueen hastily
hed never have left me a cent really
i was just useful to himlanguages and so on
youre likely to be out of luck you know if you dont speak anything but good american
im no linguist myself but i know what i call shopping and hotelsnappy bits in french and german and italian
his voice was a little louder than usual
it was as though he were slightly uneasy over the search in spite of his expressed willingness
poirot emerged
nothing he said
not even a compromising bequest
macqueen sighed
well thats a load off my mind he said humorously
they moved on to the last compartment
the examination of the luggage of the big italian and of the valet yielded no result
the three men stood at the end of the coach looking at each other
what next
said m bouc
we will go back to the diningcar said poirot
we know now all that we can know
we have the evidence of the passengers the evidence of their baggage the evidence of our eyes
 we can expect no further help
it must be our part now to use our brains
he felt in his pocket for his cigarette case
it was empty
i will join you in a moment he said
i shall need the cigarettes
this is a very difficult a very curious affair
who wore that scarlet kimono
where is it now
i wish i knew
there is something in this casesome factorthat escapes me
it is difficult because it has been made difficult
but we will discuss it
pardon me a moment
he went hurriedly along the corridor to his own compartment
he had he knew a further supply of cigarettes in one of his valises
he got it down and snapped back the lock
then he sat back on his heels and stared
neatly folded on the top of the case was a thin scarlet silk kimono embroidered with dragons
so he murmured
it is like that
a defiance
very well i take it up
part iiihercule poirot sits back and thinks1which of them
m bouc
and dr constantine were talking together when poirot entered the diningcar
m bouc was looking depressed
le voila said the latter when he saw poirot
then he added as his friend sat down if you solve this case mon cher i shall indeed believe in miracles
it worries you this case
naturally it worries me
i cannot make head or tail of it
i agree said the doctor
he looked at poirot with interest
to be frank he said i cannot see what you are going to do next
no
said poirot thoughtfully
he took out his cigarette case and lit one of his tiny cigarettes
his eyes were dreamy
that to me is the interest of this case he said
we are cut off from all the normal routes of procedure
are these people whose evidence we have taken speaking the truth or lying
we have no means of finding outexcept such means as we can devise ourselves
it is an exercise this of the brain
that is all very fine said m bouc
but what have you to go upon
i told you just now
we have the evidence of the passengers and the evidence of our own eyes
pretty evidencethat of the passengers
it told us just nothing at all
poirot shook his head
i do not agree my friend
the evidence of the passengers gave us several points of interest
indeed said m bouc sceptically
i did not observe it
that is because you did not listen
well tell me what did i miss
i will just take one instancethe first evidence we heard that of the young macqueen
he uttered to my mind one very significant phrase
about the letters
no not about the letters
as far as i can remember his words were we travelled about
mr ratchett wanted to see the world
he was hampered by knowing no languages
i acted more as a courier than a secretary
he looked from the doctors face to that of m bouc
what
you still do not see
that is inexcusablefor you had a second chance again just now when he said youre likely to be out of luck if you dont speak anything but good american
you mean
m bouc still looked puzzled
ah it is that you want it given to you in words of one syllable
well here it is
m ratchett spoke no french
yet when the conductor came in answer to his bell last night it was a voice speaking in french that told him that it was a mistake and that he was not wanted
it was moreover a perfectly idiomatic phrase that was used not one that a man knowing only a few words of french would have selected
ce nest rien je me suis trompe
it is true cried constantine excitedly
we should have seen that
i remember your laying stress on the words when you repeated them to us
now i understand your reluctance to rely upon the evidence of the dented watch
already at twentythree minutes to one ratchett was deadand it was his murderer speaking
finished m bouc impressively
poirot raised a deprecating hand
let us not go too fast
and do not let us assume more than we actually know
it is safe i think to say that at that timetwentythree minutes to onesome other person was in ratchetts compartment and that that person either was french or could speak the french language fluently
you are very cautious mon vieuxone should advance only a step at a time
we have no actual evidence that ratchett was dead at that time
there is the cry that awakened you
yes that is true
in one way said m bouc thoughtfully this discovery does not affect things very much
you heard someone moving about next door
that someone was not ratchett but the other man
doubtless he is washing blood from his hands clearing up after the crime burning the incriminating letter
then he waits till all is still and when he thinks it is safe and the coast is clear he locks and chains ratchetts door on the inside unlocks the communicating door through into mrs hubbards compartment and slips out that way
in fact it is exactly as we thought with the difference that ratchett was killed about half an hour earlier and the watch put on to a quarter past one to create an alibi
not such a famous alibi said poirot
the hands of the watch pointed to 115the exact time when the intruder actually left the scene of the crime
true said m bouc a little confused
what then does the watch convey to you
if the hands were alteredi say ifthen the time at which they were set must have a significance
the natural reaction would be to suspect anyone who had a reliable alibi for the time indicatedin this case 115
yes yes said the doctor
that reasoning is good
we must also pay a little attention to the time the intruder entered the compartment
when had he an opportunity of doing so
unless we are to assume the complicity of the real conductor there was only one time when he could have done soduring the time the train stopped at vincovci
after the train left vincovci the conductor was sitting facing the corridor and whereas any one of the passengers would pay little attention to a wagon lit attendant the one person who would notice an impostor is the real conductor
but during the halt at vincovci the conductor is out on the platform
the coast is clear
and by our former reasoning it must be one of the passengers said m bouc
we come back to where we were
which of them
poirot smiled
i have made a list he said
if you like to see it it will perhaps refresh your memory
the doctor and m bouc pored over the list together
it was written out neatly in a methodical manner in the order in which the passengers had been interviewed

and went to mistress
notethe evidence of the passengers is supported by the statement of the conductor that no one entered or left mr ratchetts compartment from midnight to 1 oclock when he himself went into the next coach and from 115 to 2 oclock
that document you understand said poirot is a mere precis of the evidence we heard arranged in that way for convenience
with a grimace m bouc handed it back
it is not illuminating he said
perhaps you may find this more to your taste said poirot with a slight smile as he handed him a second sheet of paper
2ten questionson the paper was writtenthings needing explanationthe handkerchief marked with the initial h whose is it
the pipecleaner
was it dropped by colonel arbuthnot
or by someone else
who wore the scarlet kimono
who was the man or woman masquerading in wagon lit uniform
why do the hands of the watch point to 115
was the murder committed at that time
was it earlier
was it later
can we be sure that ratchett was stabbed by more than one person
what other explanation of his wounds can there be
well let us see what we can do said m bouc brightening a little at this challenge to his wits
the handkerchief to begin with
let us by all means be orderly and methodical
assuredly said poirot nodding his head in a satisfied fashion
m bouc continued somewhat didactically
the initial h is connected with three peoplemrs hubbard miss debenham whose second name is hermione and the maid hildegarde schmidt
ah
and of those three
it is difficult to say
but i think i should vote for miss debenham
for all one knows she may be called by her second name and not her first
also there is already some suspicion attaching to her
that conversation you overheard mon cher was certainly a little curious and so is her refusal to explain it
as for me i plump for the american said dr constantine
it is a very expensive handkerchief that and americans as all the world knows do not care what they pay
so you both eliminate the maid
asked poirot
yes
as she herself said it is the handkerchief of a member of the upper classes
and the second questionthe pipecleaner
did colonel arbuthnot drop it or somebody else
that is more difficult
the english they do not stab
you are right there
i incline to the view that someone else dropped the pipecleanerand did so to incriminate the longlegged englishman
as you said m poirot put in the doctor two clues is too much carelessness
i agree with m bouc
the handkerchief was a genuine oversighthence none of the women will admit that it is hers
the pipecleaner is a faked clue
in support of that theory you notice that colonel arbuthnot shows no embarrassment and admits freely to smoking a pipe and using that type of cleaner
you reason well said poirot
question no
3who wore the scarlet kimono
went on m bouc
as to that i will confess i have not the slightest idea
have you any views on the subject dr
constantine
none
then we confess ourselves beaten there
the next question has at any rate possibilities
who was the man or the woman masquerading in wagon lit uniform
well one can list with certainty a number of people that it could not have been
hardman colonel arbuthnot foscarelli count andrenyi and hector macqueen are all too tall
mrs hubbard hildegarde schmidt and greta ohlsson are too broad
that leaves the valet miss debenham princess dragomiroff and countess andrenyiand none of them sounds likely
greta ohlsson in one case and antonio foscarelli in the other both swear that miss debenham and the valet never left their compartments
hildegarde schmidt swears that the princess was in hers and count andrenyi has told us that his wife took a sleeping draught
therefore it seems impossible that it can be anybodywhich is absurd
as our old friend euclid says murmured poirot
it must be one of those four said dr constantine
unless it is someone from outside who has found a hidingplaceand that we agreed was impossible
m bouc had passed on to the next question on the list
no
5why do the hands of the broken watch point to 115
i can see two explanations of that
either it was done by the murderer to establish an alibi and afterwards when he meant to leave the compartment he was prevented by hearing people moving about or elsewaiti have an idea comingthe other two waited respectfully while m bouc struggled in mental agony
i have it he said at last
it was not the wagon lit murderer who tampered with the watch
it was the person we have called the second murdererthe lefthanded personin other words the woman in the scarlet kimono
she arrives later and moves back the hands of the watch in order to make an alibi for herself
bravo said dr constantine
it is well imagined that
in fact said poirot she stabbed him in the dark not realizing that he was dead already but somehow deduced that he had a watch in his pyjama pocket took it out put back the hands blindly and gave it the requisite dent
m bouc looked at him coldly
have you anything better to suggest yourself
he asked
at the momentno admitted poirot
all the same he went on i do not think you have either of you appreciated the most interesting point about that watch
does question no
6 deal with it
asked the doctor
to that questionwas the murder committed at that time 115i answer no
i agree said m bouc
was it earlier
is the next question
i sayyes
you too doctor
the doctor nodded
yes but the question was it later
can also be answered in the affirmative
i agree with your theory m bouc and so i think does m poirot although he does not wish to commit himself
the first murderer came earlier than 1
15 but the second murderer came after 115
and as regards the question of lefthandedness ought we not to take steps to ascertain which of the passengers is lefthanded
i have not completely neglected that point said poirot
you may have noticed that i made each passenger write either a signature or an address
that is not conclusive because some people do certain actions with the right hand and others with the left
some write righthanded but play golf lefthanded
still it is something
every person questioned took the pen in his or her right handwith the exception of princess dragomiroff who refused to write
princess dragomiroffimpossible said m bouc
i doubt if she would have had the strength to inflict that lefthanded blow said dr constantine dubiously
that particular wound had been inflicted with considerable force
more force than a woman could use
no i would not say that
but i think more force than an elderly woman could display and princess dragomiroffs physique is particularly frail
it might be a question of the influence of mind over body said poirot
princess dragomiroff has great personality and immense willpower
but let us pass from that for the moment
to questions nos
9 and 10
can we be sure that ratchett was stabbed by more than one person and what other explanation of the wounds can there be
in my opinion medically speaking there can be no other explanation of those wounds
to suggest that one man struck first feebly and then with violence first with the right hand and then with the left and after an interval of perhaps half an hour inflicted fresh wounds on a dead bodywell it does not make sense
no said poirot
it does not make sense
and you think that two murderers do make sense
as you yourself have said what other explanation can there be
poirot stared straight ahead of him
that is what i ask myself he said
that is what i never cease to ask myself
he leaned back in his seat
from now on it is all here
he tapped himself on the forehead
we have thrashed it all out
the facts are all in front of usneatly arranged with order and method
the passengers have sat here one by one giving their evidence
we know all that can be knownfrom outside 
he gave m bouc an affectionate smile
it has been a little joke between us has it notthis business of sitting back and thinking out the truth
well i am about to put my theory into practicehere before your eyes
you two must do the same
let us all three close our eyes and think
one or more of those passengers killed ratchett
which of them
3certain suggestive pointsit was quite a quarter of an hour before anyone spoke
m bouc and dr constantine had started by trying to obey poirots instructions
they had endeavoured to see through a maze of conflicting particulars to a clear and outstanding solution
m boucs thoughts had run something as followsassuredly i must think
but as far as that goes i have already thought
 poirot obviously thinks that this english girl is mixed up in the matter
i cannot help feeling that that is most unlikely

the english are extremely cold
probably it is because they have no figures

but that is not the point
it seems that the italian could not have done ita pity
i suppose the english valet is not lying when he said the other never left the compartment
but why should he
it is not easy to bribe the english they are so unapproachable
the whole thing is most unfortunate
i wonder when we shall get out of this
there must be some rescue work in progress
they are so slow in these countries  it is hours before anyone thinks of doing anything
and the police of these countries they will be most trying to deal withpuffed up with importance touchy on their dignity
they will make a grand affair of all this
it is not often that such a chance comes their way
it will be in all the newspapers
and from there on m boucs thoughts went along a wellworn course which they had already traversed some hundred times
dr constantines thoughts ran thushe is queer this little man
a genius
or a crank
will he solve this mystery
impossiblei can see no way out of it
it is all too confusing
 everyone is lying perhaps

but even then that does not help one
if they are all lying it is just as confusing as if they were speaking the truth
odd about those wounds
i cannot understand it

it would be easier to understand if he had been shotafter all the term gunman must mean that they shoot with a gun
a curious country america
i should like to go there
it is so progressive
when i get home i must get hold of demetrius zagonehe has been to america he has all the modern ideas

i wonder what zia is doing at this moment
if my wife ever finds outhis thoughts went on to entirely private matters
hercule poirot sat very still
one might have thought he was asleep
and then suddenly after a quarter of an hours complete immobility his eyebrows began to move slowly up his forehead
a little sigh escaped him
he murmured beneath his breath
but after all why not
and if sowhy if so that would explain everything
his eyes opened
they were green like a cats
he said softly eh bien
i have thought
and you
lost in their reflections both men started violently
i have thought also said m bouc just a shade guiltily
but i have arrived at no conclusion
the elucidation of crime is your metier not mine my friend
i too have reflected with great earnestness said the doctor unblushingly recalling his thoughts from certain pornographic details
i have thought of many possible theories but not one that really satisfies me
poirot nodded amiably
his nod seemed to sayquite right
that is the proper thing to say
you have given me the cue i expected
he sat very upright threw out his chest caressed his moustache and spoke in the manner of a practised speaker addressing a public meeting
my friends i have reviewed the facts in my mind and have also gone over to myself the evidence of the passengerswith this result i see nebulously as yet a certain explanation that would cover the facts as we know them
it is a very curious explanation and i cannot be sure as yet that it is the true one
to find out definitely i shall have to make certain experiments
i would like first to mention certain points which appear to me suggestive
let us start with a remark made to me by m bouc in this very place on the occasion of our first lunch together on the train
he commented on the fact that we were surrounded by people of all classes of all ages of all nationalities
that is a fact somewhat rare at this time of year
the athensparis and the bucharestparis coaches for instance are almost empty
remember also the passenger who failed to turn up
he is i think significant
then there are some minor points that strike me as suggestivefor instance the position of mrs hubbards spongebag the name of mrs armstrongs mother the detective methods of m hardman the suggestion of m macqueen that ratchett himself destroyed the charred note we found princess dragomiroffs christian name and a grease spot on a hungarian passport
the two men stared at him
do they suggest anything to you those points
asked poirot
not a thing said m bouc frankly
and m le docteur
i do not understand in the least what you are talking of
m bouc meanwhile seizing upon the one tangible thing his friend had mentioned was sorting through the passports
with a grunt he picked up that of count and countess andrenyi and opened it
is this what you mean
this dirty mark
yes
it is a fairly fresh grease spot
you notice where it occurs
at the beginning of the description of the counts wifeher christian name to be exact
but i confess that i still do not see the point
i am going to approach it from another angle
let us go back to the handkerchief found at the scene of the crime
as we stated not long ago three people are associated with the letter h mrs hubbard miss debenham and the maid hildegarde schmidt
now let us regard that handkerchief from another point of view
it is my friends an extremely expensive handkerchiefan objet de luxe handmade embroidered in paris
which of the passengers apart from the initial was likely to own such a handkerchief
not mrs hubbard a worthy woman with no pretensions to reckless extravagance in dress
not miss debenhamthat class of englishwoman has a dainty linen handkerchief not an expensive wisp of cambric costing perhaps two hundred francs
and certainly not the maid
but there are two women on the tram who would be likely to own such a handkerchief
let us see if we can connect them in any way with the letter h the two women i refer to are princess dragomiroffwhose christian name is natalia put in m bouc ironically
exactly
and her christian name as i said just now is decidedly suggestive
the other woman is countess andrenyi
and at once something strikes usyou
me then
her christian name on her passport is disfigured by a blob of grease
just an accident anyone would say
but consider that christian name
elena
suppose that instead of elena it were helena
that capital h could be turned into a capital e and then run over the small e next to it quite easilyand then a spot of grease dropped to cover up the alteration
helena
cried m bouc
it is an idea that
certainly it is an idea
i look about for any confirmation however slight of my ideaand i find it
one of the luggage labels on the countesss baggage is slightly damp
it is one that happens to run over the first initial on top of the case
that label has been soaked off and put on again in a different place
you begin to convince me said m bouc
but the countess andrenyisurelyah now mon vieux you must turn yourself round and approach an entirely different angle of the case
how was this murder intended to appear to everybody
do not forget that the snow has upset all the murderers original plan
let us imagine for a little minute that there is no snow that the train proceeded on its normal course
what then would have happened
the murder let us say would still have been discovered in all probability at the italian frontier early this morning
much of the same evidence would have been given to the italian police
the threatening letters would have been produced by m macqueen m hardman would have told his story mrs hubbard would have been eager to tell how a man passed through her compartment the button would have been found
i imagine that two things only would have been different
the man would have passed through mrs hubbards compartment just before one oclockand the wagon lit uniform would have been found cast off in one of the toilets
you mean
i mean that the murder was planned to look like an outside job
it would have been presumed that the assassin had left the train at brod where it is timed to arrive at 058
somebody would probably have passed a strange wagon lit conductor in the corridor
the uniform would be left in a conspicuous place so as to show clearly just how the trick had been played
no suspicion would have attached to the passengers
that my friends was how the affair was intended to appear to the outside world
but the accident to the train changes everything
doubtless we have here the reason why the man remained in the compartment with his victim so long
he was waiting for the train to go on
but at last he realised that the train was not going on
different plans would have to be made
the murderer would now be known to be still on the train
yes yes said m bouc impatiently
i see all that
but where does the handkerchief come in
i am returning to it by a somewhat circuitous route
to begin with you must realise that the threatening letters were in the nature of a blind
they might have been lifted bodily out of an indifferently written american crime novel
they are not real
they are in fact simply intended for the police
what we have to ask ourselves is did they deceive ratchett
on the face of it the answer seems to be no
his instructions to hardman seem to point to a definite private enemy of whose identity he was well aware
that is if we accept hardmans story as true
but ratchett certainly received one letter of a very different characterthe one containing a reference to the armstrong baby a fragment of which we found in his compartment
in case ratchett had not realised it sooner this was to make sure that he understood the reason of the threats against his life
that letter as i have said all along was not intended to be found
the murderers first care was to destroy it
this then was the second hitch in his plans
the first was the snow the second was our reconstruction of that fragment
that the note was destroyed so carefully can mean only one thing
there must be on the train someone so intimately connected with the armstrong family that the finding of that note would immediately direct suspicion upon that person
now we come to the other two clues that we found
i pass over the pipecleaner
we have already said a good deal about that
let us pass on to the handkerchief
taken at its simplest it is a clue which directly incriminates someone whose initial is h and it was dropped there unwittingly by that person
exactly said dr constantine
she finds out that she has dropped the handkerchief and immediately takes steps to conceal her christian name
how fast you go
you arrive at a conclusion much sooner than i would permit myself to do
is there any other alternative
certainly there is
suppose for instance that you have committed a crime and wish to cast the blame for it on someone else
well there is on the train a certain person connected intimately with the armstrong familya woman
suppose then that you leave there a handkerchief belonging to that woman
she will be questioned her connection with the armstrong family will be brought outet voila motiveand an incriminating article of evidence
but in such a case objected the doctor the person indicated being innocent would not take steps to conceal her identity
ah really
that is what you think
that is truly the opinion of the police court
but i know human nature my friend and i tell you that suddenly confronted with the possibility of being tried for murder the most innocent person will lose his head and do the most absurd things
no no the grease spot and the changed label do not prove guiltthey only prove that the countess andrenyi is anxious for some reason to conceal her identity
what do you think her connection with the armstrong family can be
she has never been in america she says
exactly and she speaks english with a foreign accent and she has a very foreign appearance which she exaggerates
but it should not be difficult to guess who she is
i mentioned just now the name of mrs armstrongs mother
it was linda arden and she was a very celebrated actressamong other things a shakespearean actress
think of as you like it with the forest of arden and rosalind
it was there she got the inspiration for her acting name
linda arden the name by which she was known all over the world was not her real name
it may have been goldenberg it is quite likely that she had central european blood in her veinsa strain of jewish perhaps
many nationalities drift to america
i suggest to you gentlemen that that young sister of mrs armstrongs little more than a child at the time of the tragedy was helena goldenberg the younger daughter of linda arden and that she married count andrenyi when he was an attache in washington
but princess dragomiroff says that the girl married an englishman
whose name she cannot remember
i ask you my friends is that really likely
princess dragomiroff loved linda arden as great ladies do love great artists
she was godmother to one of the actresss daughters
would she forget so quickly the married name of the other daughter
it is not likely
no i think we can safely say that princess dragomiroff was lying
she knew helena was on the train she had seen her
she realised at once as soon as she heard who ratchett really was that helena would be suspected
and so when we question her as to the sister she promptly liesis vague cannot remember but thinks helena married an englishmana suggestion as far away from the truth as possible
one of the restaurant attendants came through the door at the end and approached them
he addressed m bouc
the dinner monsieur shall i serve it
it is ready some little time
m bouc looked at poirot
the latter nodded
by all means let dinner be served
the attendant vanished through the doors at the other end
his bell could be heard ringing and his voice upraisedpremier service
le diner est servi
premier dinerfirst service
4the grease spot on a hungarian passportpoirot shared a table with m bouc and the doctor
the company assembled in the restaurant car was a very subdued one
they spoke little
even the loquacious mrs hubbard was unnaturally quiet
she murmured as she sati dont feel as though i had the heart to eat anything and then partook of everything offered her encouraged by the swedish lady who seemed to regard her as a special charge
before the meal was served poirot had caught the chief attendant by the sleeve and murmured something to him
constantine made a pretty good guess as to what the instructions had been when he noticed that the count and countess andrenyi were always served last and that at the end of the meat there was a delay in making out their bill
it therefore came about that the count and countess were the last left in the restaurant car
when they rose at length and moved in the direction of the door poirot sprang up and followed them
pardon madame you have dropped your handkerchief
he was holding out to her the tiny monogrammed square
she took it glanced at it then handed it back to him
you are mistaken monsieur that is not my handkerchief
not your handkerchief
are you sure
perfectly sure monsieur
and yet madame it has your initialthe initial hthe count made a sudden movement
poirot ignored him
his eyes were fixed on the countesss face
looking steadily at him she repliedi do not understand monsieur
my initials are e
a
i think not
your name is helenanot elena
helena goldenberg the younger daughter of linda ardenhelena goldenberg the sister of mrs
armstrong
there was a dead silence for a minute or two
both the count and the countess had gone deadly white
poirot said in a gentler tone it is of no use denying
that is the truth is it not
the count burst out furiously i demand monsieur by what right youshe interrupted him putting up a small hand towards his mouth
no rudolph
let me speak
it is useless to deny what this gentleman says
we had better sit down and talk the matter out
her voice had changed
it still had the southern richness of tone but it had become suddenly more clear cut and incisive
it was for the first time a definitely american voice
the count was silenced
he obeyed the gesture of her hand and they both sat down opposite poirot
your statement monsieur is quite true said the countess
i am helena goldenberg the younger sister of mrs
armstrong
you did not acquaint me with that fact this morning madame la comtesse
no
in fact all that your husband and you told me was a tissue of lies
monsieur
cried the count angrily
do not be angry rudolph
m poirot puts the fact rather brutally but what he says is undeniable
i am glad you admit the fact so freely madame
will you now tell me your reasons for that and also for altering your christian name on your passport
that was my doing entirely put in the count
helena said quietly surely m poirot you can guess my reasonour reason
this man who was killed is the man who murdered my baby niece who killed my sister who broke my brotherinlaws heart
three of the people i loved best and who made up my homemy world
her voice rang out passionately
she was a true daughter of that mother the emotional force of whose acting had moved huge audiences to tears
she went on more quietly
of all the people on the train i alone had probably the best motive for killing him
and you did not kill him madame
i swear to you m poirotand my husband knowsand will swear alsothat much as i may have been tempted to do so i never lifted a hand against that man
i too gentlemen
said the count
i give you my word of honour that last night helena never left her compartment
she took a sleeping draught exactly as i said
she is utterly and entirely innocent
poirot looked from one to the other of them
on my word of honour repeated the count
poirot shook his head slightly
and yet you took it upon yourself to alter the name in the passport
monsieur poirot the count said earnestly and passionately consider my position
do you think i could stand the thought of my wife dragged through a sordid police case
she was innocent i knew it but what she said was truebecause of her connection with the armstrong family she would have been immediately suspected
she would have been questionedattested perhaps
since some evil chance had taken us on the same train as this man ratchett there was i felt sure but one thing for it
i admit monsieur that i lied to youall that is save in one thing
my wife never left her compartment last night
he spoke with an earnestness that it was hard to gainsay
i do not say that i disbelieve you monsieur said poirot slowly
your family is i know a proud and ancient one
it would be bitter indeed for you to have your wife dragged into an unpleasant police case
with that i can sympathise
but how then do you explain the presence of your wifes handkerchief actually in the dead mans compartment
that handkerchief is not mine monsieur said the countess
in spite of the initial h
in spite of the initial
i have handkerchiefs not unlike that but not one that is exactly of that pattern
i know of course that i cannot hope to make you believe me but i assure you that it is so
that handkerchief is not mine
it may have been placed there by someone in order to incriminate you
she smiled a little
you are enticing me to admit that after all it is mine
but indeed m poirot it isnt
she spoke with great earnestness
then why if the handkerchief was not yours did you alter the name in the passport
the count answered this
because we heard that a handkerchief had been found with the initial h on it
we talked the matter over together before we came to be interviewed
i pointed out to helena that if it were seen that her christian name began with an h she would immediately be subjected to much more rigorous questioning
and the thing was so simpleto alter helena to elena was easily done
you have m le comte the makings of a very fine criminal remarked poirot dryly
a great natural ingenuity and an apparently remorseless determination to mislead justice
oh no no
the girl leaned forward
m poirot hes explained to you how it was
she broke from french into english
i was scaredabsolutely dead scared you understand
it had been so awfulthat timeand to have it all raked up again
and to be suspected and perhaps thrown into prison
i was just scared stiff m poirot
cant you understand at all
her voice was lovelydeeprichpleading the voice of the daughter of linda arden the actress
poirot looked gravely at her
if i am to believe you madameand i do not say that i will not believe youthen you must help me
help you
yes
the reason for the murder lies in the pastin that tragedy which broke up your home and saddened your young life
take me back into the past mademoiselle that i may find there the link that explains the whole thing
what can there be to tell you
they are all dead
she repeated mournfully all deadall deadrobert soniadarling darling daisy
she was so sweetso happyshe had such lovely curls
we were all just crazy about her
there was another victim madame
an indirect victim you might say
poor susanne
yes i had forgotten about her
the police questioned her
they were convinced that she had something to do with it
perhaps she hadbut if so only innocently
she had i believe chatted idly with someone giving information as to the time of daisys outings
the poor thing got terribly wrought upshe thought she was being held responsible
she shuddered
she threw herself out of the window
oh
it was horrible
she buried her face in her hands
what nationality was she madame
she was french
what was her last name
its absurd but i cant rememberwe all called her susanne
a pretty laughing girl
she was devoted to daisy
she was the nurserymaid was she not
yes
who was the nurse
she was a trained hospital nurse
stengelberg her name was
she too was devoted to daisyand to my sister
now madame i want you to think carefully before you answer this question
have you since you were on this train seen anyone that you recognised
she stared at him
i
no no one at all
what about princess dragomiroff
oh
her
i know her of course
i thought you meant anyoneanyone fromfrom that time
so i did madame
now think carefully
some years have passed remember
the person might have altered his or her appearance
helena pondered deeply
then she said noi am surethere is no one
you yourselfyou were a young girl at the timedid you have no one to superintend your studies or to look after you
oh
yes i had a dragona sort of governess to me and secretary to sonia combined
she was englishor rather scotch a big redhaired woman
what was her name
miss freebody
young or old
she seemed frightfully old to me
i suppose she couldnt have been more than forty
susanne of course used to look after my clothes and maid me
and there were no other inmates of the house
only servants
and you are certain quite certain madame that you have recognised no one on the train
she replied earnestly no one monsieur
no one at all
5the christian name of princess dragomiroffwhen the count and countess had departed poirot looked across at the other two
you see he said we make progress
excellent work said m bouc cordially
on my part i should never have dreamed of suspecting count and countess andrenyi
i will admit i thought them quite hors de combat
i suppose there is no doubt that she committed the crime
it is rather sad
still they will not guillotine her
there are extenuating circumstances
a few years imprisonmentthat will be all
in fact you are quite certain of her guilt
my dear friendsurely there is no doubt of it
i thought your reassuring manner was only to smooth things over till we are dug out of the snow and the police take charge
you do not believe the counts positive assertionon his word of honorthat his wife is innocent
mon chernaturallywhat else could he say
he adores his wife
he wants to save her
he tells his lie very wellquite in the grand seigneur manner
but what else than a lie could it be
well you know i had the preposterous idea that it might be the truth
no no
the handkerchief remember
the handkerchief clinches the matter
oh i am not so sure about the handkerchief
you remember i always told you that there were two possibilities as to the ownership of the handkerchief
all the samem bouc broke off
the door at the end had opened and princess dragomiroff entered the diningcar
she came straight to them and all three men rose to their feet
she spoke to poirot ignoring the others
i believe monsieur she said that you have a handkerchief of mine
poirot shot a glance of triumph at the other two
is this it madame
he produced the little square of fine cambric
that is it
it has my initial in the corner
but madame la princesse that is the letter h said m bouc
your christian namepardon meis natalia
she gave him a cold stare
that is correct monsieur
my handkerchiefs are always initialled in the russian characters
h is n in russian
m bouc was somewhat taken aback
there was something about this indomitable old lady which made him feel flustered and uncomfortable
you did not tell us that this handkerchief was yours at the inquiry this morning
you did not ask me said the princess drily
pray be seated madame said poirot
she sighed
i may as well i suppose
she sat down
you need not make a long business of this messieurs
your next question will behow did my handkerchief come to be lying by a murdered mans body
my reply to that is that i have no idea
you have really no idea
none whatever
you will excuse me madame but how much can we rely upon the truthfulness of your replies
poirot said the words very softly
princess dragomiroff answered contemptuously
i suppose you mean because i did not tell you that helena andrenyi was mrs armstrongs sister
in fact you deliberately lied to us in the matter
certainly
i would do the same again
her mother was my friend
i believe messieurs in loyaltyto ones friends and ones family and ones caste
you do not believe in doing your utmost to further the ends of justice
in this case i consider that justicestrict justicehas been done
poirot leaned forward
you see my difficulty madame
in this matter of the handkerchief even am i to believe you
or are you shielding your friends daughter
oh
i see what you mean
her face broke into a grim smile
well messieurs this statement of mine can be easily proved
i will give you the address of the people in paris who make my handkerchiefs
you have only to show them the one in question and they will inform you that it was made to my order over a year ago
the handkerchief is mine messieurs
she rose
have you anything further you wish to ask me
your maid madame did she recognise this handkerchief when we showed it to her this morning
she must have done so
she saw it and said nothing
ah well that shows that she too can be loyal
with a slight inclination of her head she passed out of the diningcar
so that was it murmured poirot softly
i noticed just a trifling hesitation when i asked the maid if she knew to whom the handkerchief belonged
she was uncertain whether or not to admit that it was her mistresss
but how does that fit in with that strange central idea of mine
yes it might well be
ah
said m bouc with a characteristic gesture
she is a terrible old lady that
could she have murdered ratchett
asked poirot of the doctor
he shook his head
those blowsthe ones delivered with great force penetrating the musclenever never could anyone with so frail a physique inflict them
but the feebler ones
the feebler ones yes
i am thinking said poirot of the incident this morning when i said to her that the strength was in her will rather than in her arm
it was in the nature of a trap that remark
i wanted to see if she would look down at her right or her left arm
she did neither
she looked at them both
but she made a strange reply
she said no i have no strength in these
i do not know whether to be sorry or glad
a curious remark that
it confirms me in my belief about the crime
it did not settle the point about the lefthandedness
no
by the way did you notice that count andrenyi keeps his handkerchief in his righthand breast pocket
m bouc shook his head
his mind reverted to the astonishing revelations of the last halfhour
he murmuredliesand again lies
it amazes me the number of lies we had told to us this morning
there are more still to discover said poirot cheerfully
you think so
i shall be very much disappointed if it is not so
such duplicity is terrible said m bouc
but it seems to please you he added reproachfully
it has this advantage said poirot
if you confront anyone who has lied with the truth he will usually admit itoften out of sheer surprise
it is only necessary to guess right to produce your effect
that is the only way to conduct this case
i select each passenger in turn consider his or her evidence and say to myself if so and so is lying on what point is he lying and what is the reason for the lie
and i answer if he is lyingif you markit could only be for such a reason and on such a point
we have done that once very successfully with countess andrenyi
we shall now proceed to try the same method on several other persons
and supposing my friend that your guess happens to be wrong
then one person at any rate will be completely freed from suspicion
aha process of elimination
exactly
and whom do we tackle next
we are going to tackle that pukka sahib colonel arbuthnot
6a second interview with colonel arbuthnotcolonel arbuthnot was clearly annoyed at being summoned to the diningcar for a second interview
his face wore a most forbidding expression as he sat down and saidwell
all my apologies for troubling you a second time said poirot
but there is still some information that i think you might be able to give us
indeed
i hardly think so
to begin with you see this pipecleaner
yes
is it one of yours
dont know
i dont put a private mark on them you know
are you aware colonel arbuthnot that you are the only man amongst the passengers in the stamboulcalais carriage who smokes a pipe
in that case it probably is one of mine
do you know where it was found
not the least idea
it was found by the body of the murdered man
colonel arbuthnot raised his eyebrows
can you tell us colonel arbuthnot how it is likely to have got there
if you mean did i drop it there myself no i didnt
did you go into mr ratchetts compartment at any time
i never even spoke to the man
you never spoke to him and you did not murder him
the colonels eyebrows went up again sardonically
if i had i should hardly be likely to acquaint you with the fact
as a matter of fact i didnt murder the fellow
ah well murmured poirot
it is of no consequence
i beg your pardon
i said that it was of no consequence
oh
arbuthnot looked taken aback
he eyed poirot uneasily
because you see continued the little man the pipecleaner it is of no importance
i can myself think of eleven other excellent explanations of its presence
arbuthnot stared at him
what i really wished to see you about was quite another matter went on poirot
miss debenham may have told you perhaps that i overheard some words spoken to you at the station of konya
arbuthnot did not reply
she said not now
when its all over
when its behind us
do you know to what those words referred
i am sorry m poirot but i must refuse to answer that question
pourquoi
the colonel said stiffly i suggest that you ask miss debenham herself for the meaning of those words
i have done so
and she refused to tell you
yes
then i should think it would have been perfectly plaineven to youthat my lips are sealed
you will not give away a ladys secret
you can put it that way if you like
miss debenham told me that they referred to a private matter of her own
then why not accept her word for it
because colonel arbuthnot miss debenham is what one might call a highly suspicious character
nonsense said the colonel with warmth
it is not nonsense
you have nothing whatever against her
not the fact that miss debenham was companion governess in the armstrong household at the time of the kidnapping of little daisy armstrong
there was a minutes dead silence
poirot nodded his head gently
you see he said
we know more than you think
if miss debenham is innocent why did she conceal that fact
why did she tell me that she had never been in america
the colonel cleared his throat
arent you possibly making a mistake
i am making no mistake
why did miss debenham lie to me
colonel arbuthnot shrugged his shoulders
you had better ask her
i still think that you are wrong
poirot raised his voice and called
one of the restaurant attendants came from the far end of the car
go and ask the english lady in no
11 if she will be good enough to come here
bien monsieur
the man departed
the four men sat in silence
colonel arbuthnots face looked as though it were carved out of wood rigid and impassive
the man returned
the lady is just coming monsieur
thank you
a minute or two later mary debenham entered the diningcar
7the identity of mary debenhamshe wore no hat
her head was thrown back as though in defiance
the sweep of her hair back from her face the curve of her nostril suggested the figurehead of a ship plunging gallantly into a rough sea
in that moment she was beautiful
her eyes went to arbuthnot for a minutejust a minute
she said to poirot you wished to see me
i wished to ask you mademoiselle why you lied to us this morning
lied to you
i dont know what you mean
you concealed the fact that at the time of the armstrong tragedy you were actually living in the house
you told me that you had never been in america
he saw her flinch for a moment and then recover herself
yes she said
that is true
no mademoiselle it was false
you misunderstood me
i mean that it is true that i lied to you
ah you admit it
her lips curved into a smile
certainly since you have found me out
you are at least frank mademoiselle
there does not seem anything else for me to be
well of course that is true
and now mademoiselle may i ask you the reason for these evasions
i should have thought the reason leapt to the eye m
poirot
it does not leap to mine mademoiselle
she said in a quiet even voice with a trace of hardness in it i have my living to get
you mean
she raised her eyes and looked him full in the face
how much do you know m poirot of the fight to get and keep decent employment
do you think that a girl who had been detained in connection with a murder case whose name and perhaps photograph were reproduced in the english papersdo you think that any nice ordinary middleclass woman would want to engage that girl as governess to her daughters
i do not see why notif no blame attached to you
oh blameit is not blameit is the publicity
so far m poirot i have succeeded in life
i have had wellpaid pleasant posts
i was not going to risk the position i had attained when no good end could have been served
i will venture to suggest mademoiselle that i would have been the best judge of that not you
she shrugged her shoulders
for instance you could have helped me in the matter of identification
what do you mean
is it possible mademoiselle that you did not recognise in the countess andrenyi mrs armstrongs young sister whom you taught in new york
countess andrenyi
no
she shook her head
it may seem extraordinary to youbut i did not recognise her
she was not grown up you see when i knew her
that was over three years ago
it is true that the countess reminded me of someone it puzzled me
but she looks so foreigni never connected her with the little american schoolgirl
i only glanced at her casually when coming into the restaurant car and i noticed her clothes more than her face
she smiled faintly
women do
and thenwelli had my own preoccupations
you will not tell me your secret mademoiselle
poirots voice was very gentle and persuasive
she said in a low voice i canti cant
and suddenly without warning she broke down dropping her face down upon her outstretched arms and crying as though her heart would break
the colonel sprang up and stood awkwardly beside her
ilook herehe stopped and turning round scowled fiercely at poirot
ill break every bone in your damned body you dirty little whippersnapper he said
monsieur protested m bouc
arbuthnot had turned back to the girl
maryfor gods sakeshe sprang up
its nothing
im all right
you dont need me any more do you m poirot
if you do you must come and find me
oh what an idiotwhat an idiot im making of myself
she hurried out of the car
arbuthnot before following her turned once more on poirot
miss debenhams got nothing to do with this businessnothing do you hear
and if shes worried and interfered with youll have me to deal with
he strode out
i like to see an angry englishman said poirot
they are very amusing
the more emotional they feel the less command they have of language
but m bouc was not interested in the emotional reactions of englishmen
he was overcome by admiration of his friend
mon cher vous etes epatant
he cried
another miraculous guess
it is incredible how you think of these things said dr constantine admiringly
oh i claim no credit this time
it was not a guess
countess andrenyi practically told me
comment
surely not
you remember i asked her about her governess or companion
i had already decided in my mind that if mary debenham were mixed up in the matter she must have figured in the household in some such capacity
yes but the countess andrenyi described a totally different person
exactly
a tall middleaged woman with red hairin fact the exact opposite in every respect of miss debenham so much so as to be quite remarkable
but then she had to invent a name quickly and there it was that the unconscious association of ideas gave her away
she said miss freebody you remember
yes
eh bien you may not know it but there is a shop in london that was called until recently debenham  freebody
with the name debenham running in her head the countess clutches at another name quickly and the first that comes is freebody
naturally i understood immediately
that is yet another lie
why did she do it
possibly more loyalty
it makes things a little difficult
ma foi
said m bouc with violence
but does everybody on this train tell lies
that said poirot is what we are about to find out
8further surprising revelationsnothing would surprise me now said m bouc
nothing
even if everybody in the train proved to have been in the armstrong household i should not express surprise
that is a very profound remark said poirot
would you like to see what your favorite suspect the italian has to say for himself
you are going to make another of these famous guesses of yours
precisely
it is really a most extraordinary case said constantine
no it is most natural
m bouc flung up his arms in comic despair
if this is what you call natural mon ami words failed him
poirot had by this time requested the diningcar attendant to fetch antonio foscarelli
the big italian had a wary look in his eye as he came in
he shot nervous glances from side to side like a trapped animal
what do you want
he said
i have nothing more to tell younothing do you hear
per dio he struck his hand on the table
yes you have something more to tell us said poirot firmly
the truth
the truth
he shot an uneasy glance at poirot
all the assurance and geniality had gone out of his manner
mais oui
it may be that i know it already
but it will be a point in your favour if it comes from you spontaneously
you talk like the american police
come cleanthat is what they saycome clean
ah
so you have had experience of the new york police
no no never
they could not prove a thing against mebut it was not for want of trying
poirot said quietly that was in the armstrong case was it not
you were the chauffeur
his eyes met those of the italian
the bluster went out of the big man
he was like a pricked balloon
since you knowwhy ask me
why did you lie this morning
business reasons
besides i do not trust the jugoslav police
they hate the italians
they would not have given me justice
perhaps it is exactly justice that they would have given you
no no i had nothing to do with this business last night
i never left my carriage
the longfaced englishman he can tell you so
it was not i who killed this pigthis ratchett
you cannot prove anything against me
poirot was writing something on a sheet of paper
he looked up and said quietly very good
you can go
foscarelli lingered uneasily
you realise that it was not i
that i could have had nothing to do with it
i said that you could go
it is a conspiracy
you are going to frame me
all for a pig of a man who should have gone to the chair
it was an infamy that he did not
if it had been meif i had been arrestedbut it was not you
you had nothing to do with the kidnapping of the child
what is that you are saying
why that little oneshe was the delight of the house
tonio she called me
and she would sit in the car and pretend to hold the wheel
all the household worshipped her
even the police came to understand that
ah the beautiful little one
his voice had softened
the tears came into his eyes
then he wheeled round abruptly on his heel and strode out of the diningcar
pietro called poirot
the diningcar attendant came at a run
the no
10the swedish lady
bien monsieur
another
cried m bouc
ah noit is not possible
i tell you it is not possible
mon cherwe have to know
even if in the end everybody on the train proves to have had a motive for killing ratchett we have to know
once we know we can settle once for all where the guilt lies
my head is spinning groaned m bouc
greta ohlsson was ushered in sympathetically by the attendant
she was weeping bitterly
she collapsed on the seat facing poirot and wept steadily into a large handkerchief
now do not distress yourself mademoiselle
do not distress yourself poirot patted her on the shoulder
just a few little words of truth that is all
you were the nurse who was in charge of little daisy armstrong
it is trueit is true wept the wretched woman
ah she was an angela little sweet trustful angel
she knew nothing but kindness and loveand she was taken away by that wicked mancruelly treatedand her poor motherand the other little one who never lived at all
you cannot understandyou cannot knowif you had been there as i wasif you had seen the whole terrible tragedy
i ought to have told you the truth about myself this morning
but i was afraidafraid
i did so rejoice that that evil man was deadthat he could not any more kill or torture little children
ah
i cannot speaki have no words
she wept with more vehemence than ever
poirot continued to pat her gently on the shoulder
theretherei comprehendi comprehend everythingeverything i tell you
i will ask you no more questions
it is enough that you have admitted what i know to be the truth
i understand i tell you
by now inarticulate with sobs greta ohlsson rose and groped her way towards the door
as she reached it she collided with a man coming in
it was the valetmasterman
he came straight up to poirot and spoke in his usual quiet unemotional voice
i hope im not intruding sir
i thought it best to come along at once sir and tell you the truth
i was colonel armstrongs batman in the war sir and afterwards i was his valet in new york
im afraid i concealed that fact this morning
it was very wrong of me sir and i thought id better come and make a clean breast of it
but i hope sir that youre not suspecting tonio in any way
old tonio sir wouldnt hurt a fly
and i can swear positively that he never left the carriage all last night
so you see sir he couldnt have done it
tonio may be a foreigner sir but hes a very gentle creature
not like those nasty murdering italians one reads about
he stopped
poirot looked steadily at him
is that all you have to say
that is all sir
he paused then as poirot did not speak he made an apologetic little bow and after a momentary hesitation left the diningcar in the same quiet unobtrusive fashion as he had come
this said dr constantine is more wildly improbable than any roman policier i have ever read
i agree said m bouc
of the twelve passengers in that coach nine have been proved to have had a connection with the armstrong case
what next i ask you
or should i say who next
i can almost give you the answer to your question said poirot
here comes our american sleuth mr
hardman
is he too coming to confess
before poirot could reply the american had reached their table
he cocked an alert eye at them and sitting down he drawled out just exactly whats up on this train
it seems bughouse to me
poirot twinkled at him
are you quite sure mr hardman that you yourself were not the gardener at the armstrong home
they didnt have a garden replied mr hardman literally
or the butler
havent got the fancy manners for a place like that
no i never had any connection with the armstrong housebut im beginning to believe im about the only one on this train who hadnt
can you beat it
thats what i saycan you beat it
it is certainly a little surprising said poirot mildly
cest rigolo burst from m bouc
have you any ideas of your own about the crime mr
hardman
inquired poirot
no sir
its got me beat
i dont know how to figure it out
they cant all be in itbut which one is the guilty party is beyond me
how did you get wise to all this
thats what i want to know
i just guessed
then believe me youre a pretty slick guesser
yes ill tell the world youre a slick guesser
mr hardman leaned back and looked at poirot admiringly
youll excuse me he said but no one would believe it to look at you
i take off my hat to you
i do indeed
you are too kind m
hardman
not at all
ive got to hand it to you
all the same said poirot the problem is not yet quite solved
can we say with authority that we know who killed m
ratchett
count me out said mr hardman
im not saying anything at all
im just full of natural admiration
what about the other two you havent had a guess at yet
the old american dame and the ladysmaid
i suppose we can take it that theyre the only innocent parties on the train
unless said poirot smiling we can fit them into our little collection asshall we sayhousekeeper and cook in the armstrong household
well nothing in the world would surprise me now said mr hardman with quiet resignation
bughousethats what this business isbughouse
ah
mon cher that would be indeed stretching coincidence a little too far said m bouc
they cannot all be in it
poirot looked at him
you do not understand he said
you do not understand at all
tell me do you know who killed ratchett
do you
countered m bouc
poirot nodded
oh yes he said
i have known for some time
it is so clear that i wonder you have not seen it also
he looked at hardman and asked and you
the detective shook his head
he stared at poirot curiously
i dont know he said
i dont know at all
which of them was it
poirot was silent a minute
then he saidif you will be so good m hardman assemble everyone here
there are two possible solutions of this case
i want to lay them both before you all
9poirot propounds two solutionsthe passengers came crowding into the restaurant car and took their seats round the tables
they all bore more or less the same expression one of expectancy mingled with apprehension
the swedish lady was still weeping and mrs hubbard was comforting her
now you must just take a hold on yourself my dear
everythings going to be perfectly all right
you mustnt lose your grip on yourself
if one of us is a nasty murderer we know quite well it isnt you
why anyone would be crazy even to think of such a thing
you sit here and ill stay right by youand dont you worry any
her voice died away as poirot stood up
the wagon lit conductor was hovering in the doorway
you permit that i stay monsieur
certainly michel
poirot cleared his throat
messieurs et mesdames i will speak in english since i think all of you know a little of that language
we are here to investigate the death of samuel edward ratchettalias cassetti
there are two possible solutions of the crime
i shall put them both before you and i shall ask m bouc and dr constantine here to judge which solution is the right one
now you all know the facts of the case
mr ratchett was found stabbed this morning
he was last known to be alive at 1237 last night when he spoke to the wagon lit conductor through the door
a watch in his pyjama pocket was found to be badly dented and it had stopped at a quarter past one
dr constantine who examined the body when found puts the time of death as having been between midnight and two in the morning
at half an hour after midnight as you all know the train ran into a snowdrift
after that time it was impossible for anyone to leave the train
the evidence of mr hardman who is a member of a new york detective agency several heads turned to look at mr
hardman
shows that no one could have passed his compartment no
16 at the extreme end without being seen by him
we are therefore forced to the conclusion that the murderer is to be found among the occupants of one particular coachthe stamboulcalais coach
that i will say was our theory
comment
ejaculated m bouc startled
but i will put before you an alternative theory
it is very simple
mr ratchett had a certain enemy whom he feared
he gave mr hardman a description of this enemy and told him that the attempt if made at all would most probably be made on the second night out from stamboul
now i put it to you ladies and gentlemen that mr ratchett knew a good deal more than he told
the enemy as mr ratchett expected joined the train at belgrade or else at vincovci by the door left open by colonel arbuthnot and mr macqueen who had just descended to the platform
he was provided with a suit of wagon lit uniform which he wore over his ordinary clothes and a passkey which enabled him to gain access to mr ratchetts compartment in spite of the doors being locked
mr ratchett was under the influence of a sleeping draught
this man stabbed him with great ferocity and left the compartment through the communicating door leading to mrs hubbards compartmentthats so said mrs hubbard nodding her head
he thrust the dagger he had used into mrs hubbards spongebag in passing
without knowing it he lost a button of his uniform
then he slipped out of the compartment and along the corridor
he hastily thrust the uniform into a suitcase in an empty compartment and a few minutes later dressed in ordinary clothes he left the train just before it started off using the same means for egressthe door near the diningcar
everybody gasped
what about that watch
demanded mr hardman
there you have the explanation of the whole thing
mr ratchett had omitted to put his watch back an hour as he should have done at tzaribrod
his watch still registered eastern european time which is one hour ahead of central european time
it was a quarter past twelve when mr ratchett was stabbednot a quarter past one
but it is absurd that explanation
cried m bouc
what of the voice that spoke from the compartment at twentythree minutes to one
it was either the voice of ratchettor else that of his murderer
not necessarily
it might have beenwella third person
one who had gone in to speak to ratchett and found him dead
he rang the bell to summon the conductor then as you express it the wind rose in himhe was afraid of being accused of the crime and he spoke pretending to be ratchett
cest possible admitted m bouc grudgingly
poirot looked at mrs hubbard
yes madame you were going to saywell i dont quite know what i was going to say
do you think i forgot to put my watch back too
no madame
i think you heard the man pass throughbut unconsciously
later you had a nightmare of a man being in your compartment and woke up with a start and rang for the conductor
well i suppose thats possible admitted mrs hubbard
princess dragomiroff was looking at poirot with a very direct glance
how do you explain the evidence of my maid monsieur
very simply madame
your maid recognised the handkerchief i showed her as yours
she somewhat clumsily tried to shield you
she did encounter the man but earlierwhile the train was at vincovci station
she pretended to have seen him at a later hour with a confused idea of giving you a watertight alibi
the princess bowed her head
you have thought of everything monsieur
ii admire you
there was a silence
then everyone jumped as dr constantine suddenly hit the table a blow with his fist
but no he said
no no and again no
that is an explanation that will not hold water
it is deficient in a dozen minor points
the crime was not committed som poirot must know that perfectly well
poirot turned a curious glance on him
i see he said that i shall have to give you my second solution
but do not abandon this one too abruptly
you may agree with it later
he turned back again to face the others
there is another possible solution of the crime
this is how i arrived at it
when i had heard all the evidence i leaned back and shut my eyes and began to think
certain points presented themselves to me as worthy of attention
i enumerated these points to my two colleagues
some i have already elucidatedsuch as a grease spot on a passport and so on
i will run over the points that remain
the first and most important is a remark made to me by m bouc in the restaurant car at lunch on the first day after leaving stamboulto the effect that the company assembled was interesting because it was so variedrepresenting as it did all classes and nationalities
i agreed with him but when this particular point came into my mind i tried to imagine whether such an assembly was ever likely to be collected under any other conditions
and the answer i made to myself wasonly in america
in america there might be a household composed of just such varied nationalitiesan italian chauffeur an english governess a swedish nurse a german ladysmaid and so on
that led me to my scheme of guessingthat is casting each person for a certain part in the armstrong drama much as a producer casts a play
well that gave me an extremely interesting and satisfactory result
i had also examined in my own mind each separate persons evidence with some curious results
take first the evidence of mr macqueen
my first interview with him was entirely satisfactory
but in my second he made rather a curious remark
i had described to him the finding of a note mentioning the armstrong case
he said but surely and then paused and went on i meanthat was rather careless of the old man
now i could feel that that was not what he had started out to say
supposing what he had meant to say was but surely that was burnt
in which case macqueen knew of the note and of its destructionin other words he was either the murderer or an accomplice of the murderer
very good
then the valet
he said his master was in the habit of taking a sleeping draught when travelling by train
that might be true but would ratchett have taken one last night
the automatic under his pillow gave the lie to that statement
ratchett intended to be on the alert last night
whatever narcotic was administered to him must have been given without his knowledge
by whom
obviously by macqueen or the valet
now we come to the evidence of mr hardman
i believed all that he told me about his own identity but when it came to the actual methods he had employed to guard mr ratchett his story was neither more nor less than absurd
the only way to have protected ratchett effectively was to pass the night actually in his compartment or in some spot where he could watch the door
the one thing that his evidence did show plainly was that no one in any other part of the train could possibly have murdered ratchett
it drew a clear circle round the stamboulcalais carriage
that seemed to me a rather curious and inexplicable fact and i put it aside to think over
you probably all know by now of the few words i overheard between miss debenham and colonel arbuthnot
the interesting thing to my mind was the fact that colonel arbuthnot called her mary and was clearly on terms of intimacy with her
but the colonel was supposed to have met her only a few days previously
and i know englishmen of the colonels typeeven if he had fallen in love with the young lady at first sight he would have advanced slowly and with decorum not rushing things
therefore i concluded that colonel arbuthnot and miss debenham were in reality well acquainted and were for some reason pretending to be strangers
another small point was miss debenhams easy familiarity with the term long distance for a telephone call
yet miss debenham had told me that she had never been in the states
to pass to another witness
mrs hubbard had told us that lying in bed she had been unable to see whether the communicating door was bolted or not and so had asked miss ohlsson to see for her
nowthough her statement would have been perfectly true if she had been occupying compartment no
2 4 12 or any even number in which the bolt is directly under the handle of the doorin the uneven numbers such as compartment no
3 the bolt is well above the handle and could not therefore be masked by the spongebag in the least
i was forced to the conclusion that mrs hubbard was inventing an incident that had never occurred
and here let me say just a word or two about times
to my mind the really interesting point about the dented watch is the place where it was foundin ratchetts pyjama pocket a singularly uncomfortable and unlikely place to keep ones watch especially as there is a watch hook provided just by the head of the bed
i felt sure therefore that the watch had been deliberately placed in the pocketfaked
the crime then was not committed at a quarter past one
was it then committed earlier
to be exact at twentythree minutes to one
my friend m bouc advanced as an argument in favour of it the loud cry which awoke me from sleep
but if ratchett had been heavily drugged he could not have cried out
if he had been capable of crying out he would have been capable of making some kind of struggle to defend himself and there were no signs of any such struggle
i remembered that macqueen had called attention not once but twice and the second time in a very blatant manner to the fact that ratchett could speak no french
i came to the conclusion that the whole business at twentythree minutes to one was a comedy played for my benefit
anyone might see through the watch businessit is a common enough device in detective stories
they assumed that i should see through it and that pluming myself on my own cleverness i would go on to assume that since ratchett spoke no french the voice i heard at twentythree minutes to one could not have been his and that ratchett must have been already dead
but i am convinced that at twentythree minutes to one ratchett was still lying in his drugged sleep
but the device has succeeded
i have opened my door and looked out
i have actually heard the french phrase used
if i am so unbelievably dense as not to realise the significance of that phrase it must be brought to my attention
if necessary macqueen can come right out in the open
he can say excuse me m poirot that cant have been mr ratchett speaking
he couldnt speak french
now what was the real time of the crime
and who killed him
in my opinionand this is only an opinionratchett was killed at some time very close upon two oclock the latest hour the doctor gives us as possible
as to who killed himhe paused looking at his audience
he could not complain of any lack of attention
every eye was fixed upon him
in the stillness you could have heard a pin drop
he went on slowlyi was particularly struck by the extraordinary difficulty of proving a case against any one person on the train and by the rather curious coincidence that in each case the testimony giving an alibi came from what i might describe as an unlikely person
thus mr macqueen and colonel arbuthnot provided alibis for each othertwo persons between whom it seemed most unlikely there should have been any prior acquaintanceship
the same thing happened with the english valet and the italian and with the swedish lady and the english girl
i said to myself this is extraordinarythey cannot all be in it
and then messieurs i saw light
they were all in it
for so many people connected with the armstrong case to be travelling by the same train through coincidence was not only unlikely it was impossible
it must be not chance but design
i remembered a remark of colonel arbuthnots about trial by jury
a jury is composed of twelve peoplethere were twelve passengersratchett was stabbed twelve times
and the thing that had worried me all alongthe extraordinary crowd travelling in the stamboulcalais coach at a slack time of yearthis was explained
ratchett had escaped justice in america
there was no question as to his guilt
i visualised a selfappointed jury of twelve people who had condemned him to death and who by the exigencies of the case had themselves been forced to be his executioners
and immediately on that assumption the whole case fell into beautiful shining order
i saw it as a perfect mosaic each person playing his or her allotted part
it was so arranged that if suspicion should fall on any one person the evidence of one or more of the others would clear the accused person and confuse the issue
hardmans evidence was necessary in case some outsider should be suspected of the crime and be unable to prove an alibi
the passengers in the stamboul carriage were in no danger
every minute detail of their evidence was worked out beforehand
the whole thing was a very cleverly planned jigsaw puzzle so arranged that every fresh piece of knowledge that came to light made the solution of the whole more difficult
as my friend m bouc remarked the case seemed fantastically impossible
that was exactly the impression intended to be conveyed
did this solution explain everything
yes it did
the nature of the woundseach inflicted by a different person
the artificial threatening lettersartificial since they were unreal written only to be produced as evidence
doubtless there were real letters warning ratchett of his fate which macqueen destroyed substituting for them these others
then hardmans story of being called in by ratchetta lie of course from beginning to end
the description of the mythical small dark man with a womanish voicea convenient description since it had the merit of not incriminating any of the actual wagon lit conductors and would apply equally well to a man or a woman
the idea of stabbing is at first sight a curious one but on reflection nothing else would fit the circumstances so well
a dagger was a weapon that could be used by everyonestrong or weakand it made no noise
i fancy though i may be wrong that each person in turn entered ratchetts darkened compartment through that of mrs hubbardand struck
they themselves would never know which blow actually killed him
the final letter which ratchett had probably found on his pillow was carefully burnt
with no clue pointing to the armstrong case there would be absolutely no reason for suspecting any of the passengers on the train
it would be put down as an outside job and the small dark man with the womanish voice would actually have been seen by one or more of the passengers leaving the train at brod
i do not know exactly what happened when the conspirators discovered that this part of their plan was impossible owing to the accident to the train
there was i imagine a hasty consultation and then they decided to go through with it
it was true that now one and all of the passengers were bound to come under suspicion but that possibility had already been foreseen and provided for
the only additional thing to be done was to confuse the issue even further
two socalled clues were dropped in the dead mans compartmentone incriminating colonel arbuthnot who had the strongest alibi and whose connection with the armstrong family was probably the hardest to prove and the second clue the handkerchief incriminating princess dragomiroff who by virtue of her social position her particularly frail physique and the alibi given her by her maid and the conductor was practically in an unassailable position
further to confuse the issue a red herring was drawn across the trailthe mythical woman in the red kimono
again i am to bear witness to this womans existence
there is a heavy bang at my door
i get up and look outand see the scarlet kimono disappearing in the distance
a judicious selection of peoplethe conductor miss debenham and macqueenwill also have seen her
it was i think someone with a sense of humour who thoughtfully placed the scarlet kimono on the top of my suitcase whilst i was interviewing people in the diningcar
where the garment came from in the first place i do not know
i suspect it is the property of countess andrenyi since her luggage contained only a chiffon negligee so elaborate as to be rather a teagown than a dressinggown
when macqueen first learned that the letter which had been so carefully burnt had in part escaped destruction and that the word armstrong was exactly the word remaining he must at once have communicated his news to the others
it was at this minute that the position of countess andrenyi became acute and her husband immediately took steps to alter the passport
it was their second piece of bad luck
they one and all agreed to deny utterly any connection with the armstrong family
they knew i had no immediate means of finding out the truth and they did not believe that i should go into the matter unless my suspicions were aroused against one particular person
now there was one further point to consider
allowing that my theory of the crime was the correct one and i believed that it must be the correct one then obviously the wagon lit conductor himself must be privy to the plot
but if so that gave us thirteen persons not twelve
instead of the usual formula of so many people one is guilty i was faced with the problem that of thirteen persons one and one only was innocent
which was that person
i came to a very odd conclusion
i came to the conclusion that the person who had taken no part in the crime was the person who would be considered the most likely to do so
i refer to countess andrenyi
i was impressed by the earnestness of her husband when he swore to me solemnly on his honour that his wife never left her compartment that night
i decided that count andrenyi took so to speak his wifes place
if so then pierre michel was definitely one of the twelve
but how could one explain his complicity
he was a decent man who had been many years in the employ of the companynot the kind of man who could be bribed to assist in a crime
then pierre michel must be involved in the armstrong case
but that seemed very improbable
then i remembered that the dead nurserymaid had been french
supposing that that unfortunate girl had been pierre michels daughter
that would explain everythingit would also explain the place chosen for the staging of the crime
were there any others whose part in the drama was not clear
colonel arbuthnot i put down as a friend of the armstrongs
they had probably been through the war together
the maid hildegarde schmidti could guess her place in the armstrong household
i am perhaps over greedy but i sense a good cook instinctively
i laid a trap for hershe fell into it
i said i knew she was a good cook
she answered yes indeed all my ladies have said so
but if you are employed as a ladysmaid your employers seldom have a chance of learning whether or not you are a good cook
then there was hardman
he seemed quite definitely not to belong to the armstrong household
i could only imagine that he had been in love with the french girl
i spoke to him of the charm of foreign womenand again i obtained the reaction i was looking for
sudden tears came into his eyes which he pretended were dazzled by the snow
there remains mrs hubbard
now mrs hubbard let me say played the most important part in the drama
by occupying the compartment communicating with that of ratchett she was more open to suspicion than anyone else
in the nature of things she could not have an alibi to fall back upon
to play the part she playedthe perfectly natural slightly ridiculous american fond motheran artist was needed
but there was an artist connected with the armstrong family mrs armstrongs motherlinda arden the actress 
he stopped
then in a soft rich dreamy voice quite unlike the one she had used throughout the journey mrs hubbard saidi always fancied myself in comedy parts
she went on still dreamilythat slip about the spongebag was silly
it shows that you should always rehearse property
we tried it on the way outi was in an evennumber compartment then i suppose
i never thought of the bolts being in different places
she shifted her position a little and looked straight at poirot
you know all about it m poirot
youre a very wonderful man
but even you cant quite imagine what it was likethat awful day in new york
i was just crazy with grief so were the servants
and colonel arbuthnot was there too
he was john armstrongs best friend
he saved my life in the war said arbuthnot
we decided then and there perhaps we were madi dont know that the sentence of death that cassetti had escaped had got to be carried out
there were twelve of usor rather eleven susannes father was over in france of course
first we thought wed draw lots as to who should do it but in the end we decided on this way
it was the chauffeur antonio who suggested it
mary worked out all the details later with hector macqueen
hed always adored soniamy daughterand it was he who explained to us exactly how cassettis money had managed to get him off
it took a long time to perfect our plan
we had first to track ratchett down
hardman managed that in the end
then we had to try and get masterman and hector into his employmentor at any rate one of them
well we managed that
then we had a consultation with susannes father
colonel arbuthnot was very keen on having twelve of us
he seemed to think it made it more in order
he didnt like the stabbing idea much but he agreed that it did solve most of our difficulties
well susannes father was willing
susanne had been his only child
we knew from hector that ratchett would be coming back from the east sooner or later by the orient express
with pierre michel actually working on that train the chance was too good to be missed
besides it would be a good way of not incriminating any outsiders
my daughters husband had to know of course and he insisted on coming on the train with her
hector wangled it so that ratchett selected the right day for travelling when michel would be on duty
we meant to engage every carriage in the stamboulcalais coach but unfortunately there was one carriage we couldnt get
it had been reserved long beforehand for a director of the company
mr
harris of course was a myth
but it would have been awkward to have any stranger in hectors compartment
and then at the last minute you came
she stopped
well she said you know everything now m poirot
what are you going to do about it
if it must all come out cant you lay the blame upon me and me only
i would have stabbed that man twelve times willingly
it wasnt only that he was responsible for my daughters death and her childs and that of the other child who might have been alive and happy now
it was more than that there had been other children kidnapped before daisy and there might be others in the future
society had condemned himwe were only carrying out the sentence
but its unnecessary to bring all these others into it
all these good faithful soulsand poor micheland mary and colonel arbuthnotthey love each other
her voice was wonderful echoing through the crowded spacethat deep emotional heartstirring voice that had thrilled many a new york audience
poirot looked at his friend
you are a director of the company m bouc he said
what do you say
m bouc cleared his throat
in my opinion m poirot he said the first theory you put forward was the correct onedecidedly so
i suggest that that is the solution we offer to the jugoslavian police when they arrive
you agree doctor
certainly i agree said dr constantine
as regards the medical evidence i thinkerthat i made one or two fantastic suggestions
then said poirot having placed my solution before you i have the honour to retire from the case
the end
