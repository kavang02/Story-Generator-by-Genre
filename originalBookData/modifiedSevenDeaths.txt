day one  i forget everything between footsteps
anna i finish shouting snapping my mouth shut in surprise
my mind has gone blank
i dont know who anna is or why im calling her name
i dont even know how i got here
im standing in a forest shielding my eyes from the spitting rain
my hearts thumping i reek of sweat and my legs are shaking
i must have been running but i cant remember why
how did im cut short by the sight of my own hands
theyre bony ugly
a strangers hands
i dont recognise them at all
feeling the first touch of panic i try to recall something else about myself a family member my address age anything but nothings coming
i dont even have a name
every memory i had a few seconds ago is gone
my throat tightens breaths coming loud and fast
the forest is spinning black spots inking my sight
be calm
i cant breathe i gasp blood roaring in my ears as i sink to the ground my fingers digging into the dirt
you can breathe you just need to calm down
theres comfort in this inner voice cold authority
close your eyes listen to the forest
collect yourself
obeying the voice i squeeze my eyes shut but all i can hear is my own panicked wheezing
for the longest time it crushes every other sound but slowly ever so slowly i work a hole in my fear allowing other noises to break through
raindrops are tapping the leaves branches rustling overhead
theres a stream away to my right and crows in the trees their wings cracking the air as they take flight
somethings scurrying in the undergrowth the thump of rabbit feet passing near enough to touch
one by one i knit these new memories together until ive got five minutes of past to wrap myself in
its enough to staunch the panic at least for now
i get to my feet clumsily surprised by how tall i am how far from the ground i seem to be
swaying a little i wipe the wet leaves from my trousers noticing for the first time that im wearing a dinner jacket the shirt splattered with mud and red wine
i must have been at a party
my pockets are empty and i dont have a coat so i cant have strayed too far
thats reassuring
judging by the light its morning so ive probably been out here all night
no one gets dressed up to spend an evening alone which means somebody must know im missing by now
surely beyond these trees a house is coming awake in alarm search parties striking out to find me
my eyes roam the trees halfexpecting to see my friends emerging through the foliage pats on the back and gentle jokes escorting me back home but daydreams wont deliver me from this forest and i cant linger here hoping for rescue
im shivering my teeth chattering
i need to start walking if only to keep warm but i cant see anything except trees
theres no way to know whether im moving towards help or blundering away from it
at a loss i return to the last concern of the man i was
anna  whoever this woman is shes clearly the reason im out here but i cant picture her
perhaps shes my wife or my daughter
neither feels right and yet theres a pull in the name
i can feel it trying to lead my mind somewhere
anna i shout more out of desperation than hope
help me a woman screams back
i spin seeking the voice dizzying myself glimpsing her between distant trees a woman in a black dress running for her life
seconds later i spot her pursuer crashing through the foliage after her
you there stop i yell but my voice is weak and weary they trample it underfoot
shock pins me in place and the two of them are almost out of sight by the time i give chase flying after them with a haste id never have thought possible from my aching body
even so no matter how hard i run theyre always a little ahead
sweat pours off my brow my already weak legs growing heavier until they give out sending me sprawling into the dirt
scrambling through the leaves i heave myself up in time to meet her scream
it floods the forest sharp with fear and is cut silent by a gunshot
anna i call out desperately
anna  theres no response just the fading echo of the pistols report
thirty seconds
thats how long i hesitated when i first spotted her and thats how far away i was when she was murdered
thirty seconds of indecision thirty seconds to abandon somebody completely
theres a thick branch by my feet and picking it up i swing it experimentally comforted by the weight and rough texture of the bark
it wont do me very much good against a pistol but its better than investigating these woods with my hands in the air
im still panting still trembling after the run but guilt nudges me in the direction of annas scream
wary of making too much noise i brush aside the lowhanging branches searching for something i dont really want to see
twigs crack to my left
i stop breathing listening fiercely
the sound comes again footsteps crunching over leaves and branches circling around behind me
my blood runs cold freezing me in place
i dont dare look over my shoulder
the cracking of twigs moves closer shallow breaths only a little behind me
my legs falter the branch dropping from my hands
i would pray but i dont remember the words
warm breath touches my neck
i smell alcohol and cigarettes the odour of an unwashed body
east a man rasps dropping something heavy into my pocket
the presence recedes his steps retreating into the woods as i sag pressing my forehead to the dirt inhaling the smell of wet leaves and rot tears running down my cheeks
my relief is pitiable my cowardice lamentable
i couldnt even look my tormentor in the eye
what kind of man am i
its some minutes before my fear thaws sufficiently for me to move and even then im forced to lean against a nearby tree to rest
the murderers gift jiggles in my pocket and dreading what i might find i plunge my hand inside withdrawing a silver compass
oh i say surprised
the glass is cracked and the metal scuffed the initials sb engraved on the underside
i dont understand what they mean but the killers instructions were clear
im to use the compass to head east
i glance at the forest guiltily
annas body must be near but im terrified of the killers reaction should i arrive upon it
perhaps thats why im alive because i didnt come any closer
do i really want to test the limits of his mercy
assuming thats what this is
for the longest time i stare at the compasss quivering needle
theres not much im certain of any more but i know murderers dont show mercy
whatever game hes playing i cant trust his advice and i shouldnt follow it but if i dont
i search the forest again
every direction looks the same trees without end beneath a sky filled with spite
how lost do you have to be to let the devil lead you home
this lost i decide
precisely this lost
easing myself off the tree i lay the compass flat in my palm
it yearns for north so i point myself east against the wind and cold against the world itself
hope has deserted me
im a man in purgatory blind to the sins that chased me here
2   the wind howls the rain has picked up and is hammering through the trees to bounce ankle high off the ground as i follow the compass
spotting a flash of colour among the gloom i wade towards it coming upon a red handkerchief hammered to a tree – the relic of some longforgotten childs game id guess
i search for another finding it a few feet away then another and another
stumbling between them i make my way through the murk until i reach the edge of the forest the trees giving way to the grounds of a sprawling georgian manor house its redbrick façade entombed in ivy
as far as i can tell its abandoned
the long gravel driveway leading to the front door is covered in weeds and the rectangle lawns either side of it are marshland their flowers left to wither in the verge
i look for some sign of life my gaze roaming the dark windows until i spot a faint light on the first floor
it should be a relief yet still i hesitate
i have the sense of having stumbled upon something sleeping that uncertain light the heartbeat of a creature vast and dangerous and still
why else would a murderer gift me this compass if not to lead me into the jaws of some greater evil
its the thought of anna that drives me to take the first step
she lost her life because of those thirty seconds of indecision and now im faltering again
swallowing my nerves i wipe the rain from my eyes and cross the lawn climbing the crumbling steps to the front door
i hammer it with a childs fury dashing the last of my strength on the wood
something terrible happened in that forest something that can still be punished if i can only rouse the occupants of the house
unfortunately i cannot
despite beating myself limp against the door nobody comes to answer it
cupping my hands i press my nose to the tall windows either side but the stained glass is thick with dirt reducing everything inside to a yellowy smudge
i bang on them with my palm stepping back to search the front of the house for another way in
thats when i notice the bell pull the rusty chain tangled in ivy
wrenching it free i give it a good yank and keep going until something shifts behind the windows
the doors opened by a sleepylooking fellow so extraordinary in his appearance that for a moment we simply stand there gawping at each other
hes short and crooked shrivelled by the fire thats scarred half his face
overlarge pyjamas hang off a coathanger frame a ratty brown dressing gown clinging to his lopsided shoulders
he looks barely human a remnant of some prior species lost in the folds of our evolution
oh thank heavens i need your help i say recovering myself
he looks at me mouth agape
do you have a telephone i try again
we need to send for the authorities  nothing
dont just stand there you devil i cry shaking him by the shoulders before pushing past him into the entrance hall my jaw dropping as my gaze sweeps the room
every surface is glittering the checked marble floor reflecting a crystal chandelier adorned with dozens of candles
framed mirrors line the walls a wide staircase with an ornate railing sweeping up towards a gallery a narrow red carpet flowing down the steps like the blood of some slaughtered animal
a door bangs at the rear of the room and half a dozen servants appear from deeper in the house their arms laden with pink and purple flowers the scent just about covering the smell of hot wax
all conversation stops when they notice the nightmare panting by the door
one by one they turn towards me the hall holding its breath
before long the only sound is the dripping of my clothes on their nice clean floor
plink
plink
plink
sebastian  a handsome blond fellow in a cricket sweater and linen trousers is trotting down the staircase two steps at a time
he looks to be in his early fifties though age has left him decadently rumpled rather than weary and worn
keeping his hands in his pockets he crosses the floor towards me cutting a straight line through the silent servants who part before him
i doubt he even notices them so intent are his eyes upon me
my dear man what on earth happened to you he asks concern crumpling his brow
last i saw  we must fetch the police i say clutching his forearm
annas been murdered  shocked whispers spring up around us
he frowns at me casting a quick glance at the servants whove all taken a step closer
anna he asks in a hushed voice
yes anna she was being chased  by whom  some figure in black we must involve the police  shortly shortly lets go up to your room first he soothes ushering me towards the staircase
i dont know if its the heat of the house or the relief of finding a friendly face but im beginning to feel faint and i have to use the banister to keep from stumbling as we climb the steps
a grandfather clock greets us at the top its mechanism rusting seconds turned to dust on its pendulum
its later than i thought almost 1030 am
passages either side of us lead off into opposite wings of the house although the one into the east wing is blocked by a velvet curtain thats been hastily nailed to the ceiling a small sign pinned to the material proclaiming the area under decoration
impatient to unburden myself of the mornings trauma i try again to raise the issue of anna but my samaritan silences me with a conspiratorial shake of the head
these damnable servants will smear your words up and down the house in half a minute he says his voice low enough to scoop off the floor
best we talk in private  hes away from me in two strides but i can barely walk in a straight line let alone keep pace
my dear man you look dreadful he says noticing that ive fallen behind
supporting my arm he guides me along the passage his hand at my back fingers pressed against my spine
though its a simple gesture i can feel his urgency as he leads me along a gloomy corridor with bedrooms either side maids dusting inside
the walls must have been recently repainted for the fumes are making my eyes water further evidence of a hurried restoration gathering as we progress along the passage
mismatched stain is splashed across the floorboards rugs laid down to try and muffle creaking joints
wingback chairs have been arranged to hide the cracks in the walls while paintings and porcelain vases attempt to lure the eye from crumbling cornices
given the extent of the decay such concealment seems a futile gesture
theyve carpeted a ruin
ah this is your bedroom isnt it says my companion opening a door near the end of the corridor
cold air slaps me in the face reviving me a little but he walks ahead to close the raised window its pouring through
following behind i enter a pleasant room with a fourposter bed sitting in the middle of the floor its regal bearing only slightly let down by the sagging canopy and threadbare curtains their embroidered birds flying apart at the seams
a folding screen has been pulled across the left side of the room an iron bathtub visible through the gaps between the panels
other than that furnitures sparse – just a nightstand and a large wardrobe near the window both of them splintered and faded
about the only personal item i can see is a king james bible on the nightstand its cover worn through and pages dogeared
as my samaritan wrestles with the stiff window i come to stand beside him the view momentarily driving all else from my mind
dense forest surrounds us its green canopy unbroken by either a village or a road
without that compass without a murderers kindness id never have found this place and yet i cannot shake the feeling that ive been lured into a trap
after all why kill anna and spare myself if there wasnt some grander plan behind it
what does this devil want from me that he couldnt take in the forest
slamming the window shut my companion gestures to an armchair next to a subdued fire and passing me a crisp white towel from the cupboard he sits down on the edge of the bed tossing one leg across the other
start at the beginning old love he says
there isnt time i say gripping the arm of the chair
ill answer all your questions in due course but we must first call for the police and search those woods
theres a madman loose  his eyes flicker across me as though the truth of the matter is to be found in the folds of my soiled clothing
im afraid we cant call anybody theres no line up here he says rubbing his neck
but we can search the woods and send a servant to the village should we find anything
how long will it take you to change
youll need to show us where it happened  well – im wringing the towel in my hands – its difficult i was disorientated  descriptions then he says hitching up a trouser leg exposing the grey sock at his ankle
what did the murderer look like  i never saw his face he was wearing a heavy black coat  and this anna  she was also wearing black i say heat rising into my cheeks as i realise this is the extent of my information
iwell i only know her name  forgive me sebastian i assumed she was a friend of yours  no i stammer
i mean perhaps
i cant be certain  hands dangling between his knees my samaritan leans forward with a confused smile
im missing something i think
how can you know her name but not be certain  my memory is lost dammit i interrupt the confession thudding on the floor between us
i cant remember my own name let alone those of my friends  scepticism billows up behind his eyes
i cant blame him even to my ears this all sounds absurd
my memory has no bearing on what i witnessed i insist clutching at the tatters of my credibility
i saw a woman being chased she screamed and was silenced by a gunshot
we have to search those woods  i see he pauses brushing some lint from a trouser leg
his next words are offerings carefully chosen and even more carefully placed before me
is there a chance the two people you saw were lovers
playing a game in the woods perhaps
the sound might have been a branch cracking even a starters pistol  no no she called for help she was afraid i say my agitation sending me leaping from the chair the dirty towel thrown on the floor
of course of course he says reassuringly watching me pace
i do believe you my dear fellow but the police are so precise about these things and they do delight in making their betters look foolish  i stare at him helplessly drowning in a sea of platitudes
her killer gave me this i say suddenly remembering the compass which i tug from my pocket
its smeared with mud forcing me to wipe it clean with my sleeve
there are letters on the back i say pointing a trembling finger towards them
he views the compass through narrowed eyes turning it over in methodical fashion
sb he says slowly looking up at me
yes  sebastian bell he pauses weighing my confusion
thats your name sebastian
these are your initials
this is your compass  my mouth opens and closes no sound coming out
i must have lost it i say eventually
perhaps the killer picked it up  perhaps he nods
its his kindness that knocks the wind out of me
he thinks im half mad a drunken fool who spent the night in the forest and came back raving
yet instead of being angry he pities me
thats the worst part
angers solid it has weight
you can beat your fists against it
pitys a fog to become lost within
i drop into the chair my head cradled in my hands
theres a killer on the loose and i have no way of convincing him of the danger
a killer who showed you the way home
i know what i saw i say
you dont even know who you are
im sure you do says my companion mistaking the nature of my protest
i stare at nothing thinking only of a woman called anna lying dead in the forest
look you rest here he says standing up
ill ask around the house see if anybodys missing
maybe that will turn something up  his tone is conciliatory but matter of fact
kind as hes been to me i cannot trust his doubt will get anything done
once that door closes behind him hell scatter a few halfhearted questions among the staff while anna lies abandoned
i saw a woman murdered i say getting to my feet wearily
a woman i should have helped and if i have to search every inch of those woods to prove it ill do so  he holds my gaze a second his scepticism faltering in the face of my certainty
where will you start he asks
there are thousands of acres of forest out there and for all your good intentions you could barely make it up the stairs
whoever this anna is shes already dead and her murderers fled
give me an hour to gather a search party and ask my questions
somebody in this house must know who she is and where she went
well find her i promise but we have to do it the right way  he squeezes my shoulder
can you do as i ask
one hour please  objections choke me but hes right
i need to rest to recover my strength and as guilty as i feel about annas death i do not want to stalk into that forest alone
i barely made it out of there the first time
i submit with a meek nod of the head
thank you sebastian he says
a baths been run
why dont you clean yourself up
ill send for the doctor and ask my valet to lay out some clothes for you
rest a little well meet in the drawing room at lunchtime  i should ask after this place before he leaves my purpose here but im impatient for him to start asking his questions so we can get on with our search
only one question seems important now and hes already opened the door by the time i find the words to ask it
do i have any family in the house i ask
anybody who might be worried about me  he glances at me over his shoulder wary with sympathy
youre a bachelor old man
no family to speak of beyond a dotty aunt somewhere with a hand on your purse strings
you have friends of course myself among them but whoever this anna is youve never mentioned her to me
truth be told until today ive never even heard you say the name  embarrassed he turns his back on my disappointment and disappears into the cold corridor the fire flickering uncertainly as the door closes behind him
3   im out of my chair before the draught fades pulling open the drawers in my nightstand searching for some mention of anna among my possessions anything to prove that she isnt the product of a lurching mind
unfortunately the bedroom is proving remarkably tightlipped
aside from a pocketbook containing a few pounds the only other personal item i come across is a goldembossed invitation a guest list on the front and a message on the back written in an elegant hand
lord and lady hardcastle request the pleasure of your company at a masquerade ball celebrating the return of their daughter evelyn from paris
celebrations will take place at blackheath house over the second weekend of september
owing to blackheaths isolation transport to the house will be arranged for all of our guests from the nearby village of abberly
the invitation is addressed to doctor sebastian bell a name it takes me a few moments to recognise as my own
my samaritan mentioned it earlier but seeing it written down along with my profession is an altogether more unsettling affair
i dont feel like a sebastian let alone a doctor
a wry smile touches my lips
i wonder how many of my patients will stay loyal when i approach them with my stethoscope on upside down
tossing the invitation back into the drawer i turn my attention to the bible on the nightstand flipping through its wellthumbed pages
paragraphs are underlined random words circled in red ink though for the life of me i cant make sense of their significance
id been hoping to find an inscription or a letter concealed inside but the bibles empty of wisdom
clutching it in both hands i make a clumsy attempt at prayer hoping to rekindle whatever faith i once possessed but the entire endeavour feels like foolishness
my religion has abandoned me along with everything else
the cupboard is next and though the pockets of my clothes turn up nothing i discover a steamer trunk buried beneath a pile of blankets
its a beautiful old thing the battered leather wrapped in tarnished iron bands a heavy clasp protecting the contents from prying eyes
a london address – my address presumably – is written in the slip though it stirs no recollection
taking off my jacket i heave the trunk onto the bare floorboards the contents clinking with every jolt
a murmur of excitement escapes me as i press the button on the clasp transforming into a groan when i discover the damned thing is locked
i tug at the lid once twice but its unyielding
i search the open drawers and sideboard again even dropping to my stomach to look under the bed but theres nothing under there but pellets of rat poison and dust
the key isnt anywhere to be found
the only place i havent searched is the area around the bathtub and i round the folding screen like a man possessed nearly leaping out of my skin when i discover a wildeyed creature lurking on the other side
its a mirror
the wildeyed creature looks as abashed as i at this revelation
taking a tentative step forward i examine myself for the first time disappointment swelling within me
only now staring at this shivering frightened fellow do i realise that i had expectations of myself
taller shorter thinner fatter i dont know but not this bland figure in the glass
brown hair brown eyes and no chin to speak of im any face in a crowd just the lords way of filling in the gaps
quickly tiring of my reflection i continue searching for the key to my trunk but aside from some toiletries and a jug of water theres nothing back here
whoever i used to be it appears i tidied myself away before disappearing
im on the verge of howling in frustration when im interrupted by a knock on the door an entire personality conveying itself in five hearty raps
sebastian are you there says a gruff voice
my names richard acker im a doctor
i was asked to look in on you  i open the door to find a huge grey moustache on the other side
its a remarkable sight the tips curling off the edge of the face theyre theoretically attached to
the man behind it is in his sixties perfectly bald with a bulbous nose and bloodshot eyes
he smells of brandy but cheerfully so as though every drop went down smiling
lord you look dreadful he says
and thats my professional opinion  taking advantage of my confusion he strolls past me tossing his black medical case onto the bed and having a good look around the room paying particular attention to my trunk
used to have one of these myself he says running an affectionate hand across the lid
lavolaille isnt it
took me to the orient and back when i was in the army
they say you shouldnt trust a frenchman but i couldnt do without their luggage  he gives it an experimental kick wincing as his foot bounces off the obstinate leather
you must have bricks in there he says cocking his head at me expectantly as though theres some sensible response to such a statement
its locked i stammer
cant find the key hmmm  i no
doctor acker i  call me dickie everybody else does he says briskly going to the window to peer outside
ive never enjoyed the name truth be told but i cant seem to shake it
daniel says youve suffered a misfortune  daniel i ask just about holding onto the back of the conversation as it streaks away from me
coleridge
chap who found you this morning  right yes  doctor dickie beams at my bafflement
memory loss is it
well not to worry i saw a few of these cases in the war and everything came back after a day or so whether the patient wanted it to or not  he shoos me towards the trunk making me sit down on top of it
tilting my head forward he examines my skull with a butchers tenderness chuckling as i wince
oh yes youve a nice bump back here he pauses considering it
probably banged your head at some point last night
id imagine thats when it all spilled out so to speak
any other symptoms headaches nausea that sort of thing  theres a voice i say a little embarrassed by the admission
a voice  in my head
i think its my voice only well its very certain about things  i see he says thoughtfully
and this voice what does it say  it gives me advice sometimes it comments on what im doing  dickies pacing behind me tugging his moustache
this advice is it how should i say all above board
nothing violent nothing perverse  absolutely not i say riled by the inference
and are you hearing it now  no  trauma he says abruptly raising a finger in the air
thats what itll be very common in fact
somebody bangs their head and all manner of strange things start going on
they see smells taste sounds hear voices
always passes in a day or two month at the outside  a month i say spinning on the trunk to look at him
how am i going to manage like this for a month
perhaps i should visit a hospital  god no terrible things hospitals he says aghast
sickness and death swept into corners diseases curled up in the beds with the patients
take my advice and go for a stroll root through your belongings talk to some friends
i saw you and michael hardcastle sharing a bottle at dinner last night several bottles actually
quite an evening by all accounts
he should be able to help and mark my words once your memories return that voice will be no more  he pauses tutting
im more concerned by that arm  were interrupted by a knock on the door dickie opening it before i can protest
its daniels valet delivering the pressed clothes he promised
sensing my indecision dickie takes the clothes dismisses the valet and lays them out on the bed for me
now where were we he says
ah yes that arm  i follow his gaze to find blood drawing patterns on my shirtsleeve
without preamble he tugs it up to reveal ugly slashes and tattered flesh beneath
they look to have scabbed over but my recent exertions must have reopened the wounds
after bending my stiff fingers one by one he fishes a small brown bottle and some bandages from his bag cleaning my injuries before dabbing them in iodine
these are knife wounds sebastian he says in a concerned voice all his good cheer turned to ash
recent ones too
it looks like you held your arm up to protect yourself like so  he demonstrates with a glass dropper from his medical bag slashing violently at his forearm which hes raised in front of his face
his reenactment is enough to bring me out in goose bumps
do you recall anything of the evening he says binding my arm so tightly that i hiss in pain
anything at all  i push my thoughts towards my missing hours
upon waking id assumed everything was lost but now i perceive this isnt the case
i can sense my memories just out of reach
they have weight and shape like shrouded furniture in a darkened room
ive simply misplaced the light to see them by
with a sigh i shake my head
nothings forthcoming i say
but this morning i saw a  woman murdered interrupts the doctor
yes daniel told me  doubt stains every word but he knots my bandage without voicing any objection
either way you need to inform the police immediately he says
whoever did this was trying to cause you significant harm  lifting his case from the bed he clumsily shakes my hand
strategic retreat my boy thats whats required here he says
talk to the stablemaster he should be able to arrange transport back to the village and from there you can rouse the constabulary
in the meantime its probably best you keep a weather eye out
there are twenty people staying in blackheath this weekend and thirty more arriving for the ball tonight
most of them arent above this sort of thing and if youve offended them well – he shakes his head – be careful thats my advice  he lets himself out and i hurriedly take the key from the sideboard to lock the door after him my shaking hands causing me to miss the hole more than once
an hour ago id thought myself a murderers plaything tormented but beyond any physical threat
surrounded by people i felt safe enough to insist we try recovering annas body from the forest thereby spurring the search for her killer
thats no longer the case
somebodys already tried to take my life and i have no intention of staying long enough for them to try again
the dead cannot expect a debt from the living and whatever i owe anna will have to be paid at distance
once ive met with my samaritan in the drawing room im going to follow dickies advice and arrange transport back to the village
its time i went home
4   water slops over the edges of the bathtub as i quickly slough off the second skin of mud and leaves coating me
im inspecting my scrubbed pink body for birthmarks or scars anything that might trigger a memory
im due downstairs in twenty minutes and i know nothing more of anna than when i first stumbled up blackheaths steps
banging into the brick wall of my mind was frustrating enough when i thought id be helping with the search but now my ignorance could scupper the entire endeavour
by the time im finished washing the bathwater is as black as my mood
feeling despondent i towel myself dry and inspect the pressed clothes the valet dropped off earlier
his selection of attire strikes me as rather prim but peering at the alternatives in the wardrobe i immediately understand his dilemma
bells clothing – for truly i cant yet reconcile us – consists of several identical suits two dinner jackets hunting wear a dozen shirts and a few waistcoats
they come in shades of grey and black the bland uniform of what appears thus far to be an extraordinarily anonymous life
the idea that this man could have inspired anybody to violence is becoming the most outlandish part of this mornings events
i dress quickly but my nerves are so ragged it takes a deep breath and a stern word to coax my body towards the door
instinct prompts me to fill my pockets before i leave my hand leaping towards the sideboard only to hover there uselessly
im trying to collect possessions that arent there and i can no longer remember
this must be bells old routine a shadow of my former life haunting me still
the pull is so strong i feel damn queer coming away empty handed
unfortunately the only thing i managed to carry back from the forest was that damnable compass but i cant see it anywhere
my samaritan – the man doctor dickie called daniel coleridge – must have taken it
agitation pricks me as i step into the corridor
i only have a mornings worth of memories and i cant even keep hold of those
a passing servant directs me to the drawing room which turns out to be on the far side of the dining hall a few doors down from the marble entrance hall i entered this morning
its an unpleasant place the dark wood and scarlet drapes bringing to mind an overlarge coffin the coal fire breathing oily smoke into the air
a dozen people are gathered and though a tables been laid with cold cuts most of the guests are flopped in leather armchairs or standing at the leaded windows staring mournfully at the frightful weather while a maid with jam stains on her apron slips unobtrusively among them gathering dirty plates and empty glasses onto a huge silver tray she can barely hold
a rotund fellow in green hunting tweeds has set himself up on the pianoforte in the corner and is playing a bawdy tune that causes offence only for the ineptness of its delivery
nobody is paying much attention to him though hes doing his best to rectify that
its almost midday but daniel is nowhere to be seen and so i busy myself inspecting the various decanters in the drinks cabinet without any clue as to what they are or what i enjoy
in the end i pour myself something brown and turn to stare at my fellow guests hoping for a flash of recognition
if one of these people is responsible for the wounds on my arm their irritation at seeing me hale and healthy should be obvious
and surely my mind wouldnt conspire to keep their identity secret should they choose to reveal themselves
assuming of course my mind can find some way of telling them apart
nearly every man is a braying beeffaced bully in hunting tweeds while the women are dressed soberly in skirts linen shirts and cardigans
unlike their boisterous husbands they move in hushed tones finding me from the corner of their eyes
i have the impression of being surreptitiously observed like a rare bird
its terribly unsettling though understandable i suppose
daniel couldnt have asked his questions without revealing my condition in the process
im now part of the entertainment whether i like it or not
nursing my drink i attempt to distract myself by eavesdropping on the surrounding conversations a sensation akin to sticking my head into a rose bush
half of them are complaining the other half are being complained at
they dont like the accommodation the food the indolence of the help the isolation or the fact they couldnt drive up themselves though heaven knows how they would have found the place
mostly though their ire is reserved for the lack of a welcome from lady hardcastle who has yet to surface despite many of them having arrived in blackheath last night – a fact they appear to have taken as a personal insult
scuse me ted says the maid trying to squeeze past a man in his fifties
hes broad chested and sunburnt beneath a thinning crop of red hair
hunting tweeds stretch around a thick body thats slipping towards fat his face lit by bright blue eyes
ted he says angrily grabbing her wrist and squeezing hard enough to make her wince
who the hell do you think youre talking to lucy
its mr stanwin to you im not downstairs with the rats any more  she nods shocked searching our faces for help
nobody moves even the piano bites its tongue
theyre all terrified of this man i realise
to my shame im little better
im frozen in place watching this exchange from the corner of my lowered eyes desperately hoping his vulgarity doesnt turn in my direction
let her go ted says daniel coleridge from the doorway
his voice is firm cold
it clatters with repercussions
stanwin breathes through his nose staring at daniel out of narrowed eyes
it shouldnt be a contest
stanwin is squat and solid and spitting venom
yet theres something in the way daniel stands there hands in his pockets head tilted that gives stanwin pause
perhaps hes wary of being hit by the train daniel appears to be waiting for
a clock drums up its courage and ticks
with a grunt stanwin releases the maid brushing past daniel on his way out muttering something i cant quite hear
the room breathes the piano resumes the heroic clock carrying on as though nothing happened
daniels eyes weigh us one by one
unable to face his scrutiny i stare at my reflection in the window
theres disgust on my face revulsion at the endless shortcomings of my character
first the murder in the woods and now this
how many injustices will i allow to walk by before i pluck up the courage to intervene
daniel approaches a ghost in the glass
bell he says softly laying a hand on my shoulder
do you have a minute  hunched beneath my shame i follow him into the study next door every pair of eyes at my back
its even gloomier in here untrimmed ivy shrouding the leaded windows paintings in dark oils soaking up what little light manages to squirm through the glass
a writing desk has been arranged with a view onto the lawn and looks recently vacated a fountain pen leaking ink onto a torn piece of blotting paper a paper knife beside it
one can only imagine the missives written in such an oppressive atmosphere
in the opposite corner near a second door out of the room a puzzled young man in hunting tweeds is peering down the speaker of a phonograph clearly wondering why the spinning record isnt flinging sound into the room
a single term at cambridge and he thinks hes isambard kingdom brunel says daniel causing the young man to look up from his puzzle
hes no more than twentyfour with dark hair and wide flattened features that give the impression of his face being pressed up against a pane of glass
seeing me he grins broadly the boy in the man appearing as if through a window
belly you bloody idiot there you are he says squeezing my hand and clapping me on the back at the same time
its like being caught in an affectionate vice
he searches my face expectantly his green eyes narrowing at my lack of recognition
its true then you cant remember a thing he says tossing a quick glance at daniel
you lucky devil
lets get to the bar so i can introduce you to a hangover  news travels fast in blackheath i say
boredoms very flat ground he says
names michael hardcastle
were old friends though i suppose were better described as recent acquaintances now  theres no hint of disappointment in the statement
in fact he seems amused by it
even at first meeting its evident michael hardcastle will be amused by most things
michael was sat next to you at dinner last night says daniel whos taken up michaels inspection of the gramophone
come to think of it thats probably why you went out and coshed yourself on the head  play along belly were hoping one day hell accidentally say something funny says michael
theres an instinctive pause for my rejoinder the rhythm of the moment collapsing under the weight of its absence
for the first time since i woke up this morning i feel a yearning for my old life
i miss knowing these men
i miss the intimacy of this friendship
my sorrow is mirrored on the faces of my companions an awkward silence digging a trench between us
hoping to recover at least some of the trust we must once have shared i roll up my sleeve to show them the bandages covering my arm blood already beginning to seep through
i wish i had coshed myself on the head i say
doctor dickie believes somebody attacked me last night  my dear fellow gasps daniel
this is because of that damn note isnt it says michael his eyes tracing my injuries
what are you talking about hardcastle asks daniel raising his eyebrows
are you saying you know something about this
why didnt you say so earlier  theres not much to it says michael sheepishly digging at the thick carpet with the toe of his shoe
a maid brought a note to the table during our fifth bottle of wine
next thing i know bellys making his excuses and trying to remember how doors work he looks at me shamefaced
i wanted to go with you but you were adamant you had to go alone
i assumed you were meeting some woman or other so i didnt press the issue and that was the last i saw of you until now  what did the message say i ask
havent the foggiest old bean i didnt see it  do you remember the maid who brought it or if bell mentioned anybody called anna asks daniel
michael shrugs wrapping his entire face around the memory
anna
doesnt ring any bells im afraid
as for the maid well he puffs up his cheeks blowing out a long breath
black dress white apron
oh dash it all coleridge be reasonable
theres dozens of them hows a man meant to keep track of their faces  he hands each of us a helpless look daniel meeting it with a disgusted shake of the head
dont worry old boy well get to the bottom of all this he says to me squeezing my shoulder
and ive an idea how  he motions towards a framed map of the estate hanging on the wall
its an architectural drawing rain spotted and yellowing at the edges but quite beautiful in its depiction of the house and grounds
as it turns out blackheath is a huge estate with a family graveyard to the west and a stable to the east a trail winding down to a lake with a boathouse clinging to the bank
aside from the driveway which is actually a stubborn road cutting straight towards the village everything else is forest
as the view from the upper windows suggests were quite alone among the trees
a cold sweat prickles my skin
i was meant to disappear in that expanse as anna did this morning
im searching for my own grave
sensing my disquiet daniel glances at me
lonely sort of place isnt it he murmurs tapping a cigarette loose from a silver case
it dangles from his lower lip as he searches his pockets for a lighter
my father brought us out here when his political career keeled over says michael lighting daniels cigarette and taking one for himself
the old man fancied himself a country squire
didnt work out quite the way hed hoped of course  i raise a questioning eyebrow
my brother was murdered by a chap called charlie carver one of our groundskeepers says michael calmly as though declaring the racing results
aghast that i could forget something so horrific i stammer out an apology
im im sorry that must have been  a terribly long time ago interrupts michael a hint of impatience in his voice
nineteen years in fact
i was only five when it happened and truthfully i can barely recall it  unlike most of the gutter press adds daniel
carver and another fellow drank themselves into a mania and grabbed thomas near the lake
they half drowned him then finished the job with a knife
he was seven or so
ted stanwin came running and drove them off with a shotgun but thomas was already dead  stanwin i ask struggling to keep the shock from my voice
the lout from lunch  oh i wouldnt go saying that too loudly says daniel
hes very well thought of by my parents is old stanwin says michael
he was a lowly gamekeeper when he tried to save thomas but father gave him one of our african plantations in thanks and the blighter made his pile  what happened to the murderers i ask
carver swung says daniel tapping ash onto the carpet
the police found the knife he used under the floorboards in his cottage along with a dozen pilfered bottles of brandy
his accomplice was never caught
stanwin says he clipped him with the shotgun but no one turned up at the local hospital with an injury and carver refused to give him up
lord and lady hardcastle were hosting a party that weekend so it could have been one of the guests but the family were adamant that none of them knew carver  rum business all round says michael tonelessly his expression black as the clouds crowding the windows
so the accomplice is still out there i say dread creeping up my spine
a murder nineteen years ago and a murder this morning
surely that cant be a coincidence
does make you wonder what the police are for doesnt it says daniel falling silent
my eyes find michael whos staring into the drawing room
its emptying out as the guests drift towards the entrance hall carrying their conversations with them
even from here i can hear the stinging swirling swarm of insults touching on everything from the rundown state of the house to lord hardcastles drunkenness and evelyn hardcastles icy demeanour
poor michael i cant imagine how it must feel to have ones family so openly ridiculed in their own home no less
look we didnt come here to bore you with ancient history says daniel fracturing the quiet
ive been asking around after anna
its not good news im afraid  nobody knows her  there isnt anybody by that name among the guests or the staff says michael
more to the point nobodys missing from blackheath  i open my mouth to protest but michael holds his hand up silencing me
you never let me finish belly
i cant gather a search party but the chaps are going hunting in about ten minutes
if you give me a vague idea where you woke up this morning ill make sure we head in that direction and keep our eyes open
fifteen of us are going out so theres a good chance well spot something  gratitude swells in my chest
thank you michael  he smiles at me through a cloud of cigarette smoke
ive never known you to overegg the pudding belly cant imagine youre doing it now  i stare at the map eager to do my part but i have no clue where i spotted anna
the murderer pointed me east and the forest disgorged me towards the front of blackheath but i can only guess for how long i walked or where i may have started from
taking a breath and trusting to providence i prod the glass with my fingertip as daniel and michael hover over my shoulder
michael nods rubbing his chin
ill tell the chaps he looks me up and down
youd better get changed
well be leaving soon  im not coming i say my voice strangled by shame
i have to
i just cant  the young man shifts awkwardly
come now  use your head michael interrupts daniel clapping a hand on my shoulder
look what was done to him
poor bell barely got out of that forest why would he want to go back  his tone softens
dont you worry bell well find your missing girl and the man who murdered her
its in our hands now
get yourself as far away from this mess as you can      5   i stand at the leaded window half concealed by the velvet drapes
out on the driveway michael is mingling with the other men
theyre heaving beneath their thick coats shotguns crooked over their elbows laughing and chatting cold breath escaping their lips
freed from the house with a slaughter to enjoy they seem almost human
daniels words were comforting but they cant absolve me
i should be out there with them searching for the body of the woman i failed
instead im running away
the very least i can do is endure the shame of watching them set off without me
dogs pass by the window straining at leads their masters are struggling to hold
the two commotions merge striking off across the lawn towards the forest in precisely the direction i indicated to daniel although i cant see my friend among them
he must be joining the group later
i wait for the last of them to disappear among the trees before returning to the map on the wall
if its correct the stables arent too far from the house
surely thats where ill find the stablemaster
he can arrange a carriage to the village and from there ill catch a train home
i turn for the drawing room only to find the doorway blocked by a huge black crow
my heart leaps and so do i straight into the sideboard sending family photographs and trinkets clattering to the floor
you dont need to be afraid says the creature taking a half step out of the gloom
its not a bird at all
its a man dressed as a medieval plague doctor his feathers a black greatcoat the beak belonging to a porcelain mask glinting in the light of a nearby lamp
presumably this is his costume for the ball tonight though that doesnt explain why hes wearing such sinister garb in the middle of the day
you startled me i say clutching my chest and laughing in embarrassment as i try to shake off my fright
he cocks his head examining me as if im a stray animal hes found sitting on the carpet
what did you bring with you he asks
im sorry  you woke up with a word on your lips what was it  do we know each other i ask glancing through the door into the drawing room hoping to see another guest
unfortunately were alone which was almost certainly his intention i realise with growing alarm
i know you he says
thats enough for now
what was the word please  why not take off the mask so we might speak face to face i say
my mask is the least of your concerns doctor bell he says
answer the question  though hes said nothing threatening the porcelain muffles his voice adding a low animal rumble to every sentence
anna i say clamping my hand on my thigh to stop my leg from jogging
he sighs
thats a pity  do you know who she is i say hopefully
nobody else in the house has ever heard of her  id be surprised if they had he says waving away my question with a gloved hand
reaching into his coat he pulls out a golden pocket watch tutting at the time
well have work to do before long but not today and not while youre in this state
well speak again soon when everythings a little clearer
in the meantime id advise you to acquaint yourself with blackheath and your fellow guests
enjoy yourself while you can doctor the footman will find you soon  the footman i say the name ringing an alarm bell somewhere deep within me
is he responsible for annas murder or the wounds on my arm  i very much doubt it says the plague doctor
the footman isnt going to stop with your arm  theres a tremendous thump behind me and i spin towards the noise
a small splash of blood smears the window a dying bird thrashing the last of its life away among the weeds and withered flowers below
the poor thing must have flown into the glass
im startled by the pity i feel a tear creeping into my eye at this wasted life
resolving to bury the bird before i do anything else i turn around intending to make my excuses to my enigmatic companion but hes already left
i look at my hands
theyre clutched so tightly my fingernails are digging into my palms
the footman i repeat to myself
the name means nothing but the feeling it evokes is unmistakable
for some reason im terrified of this person
fear carries me over to the writing desk and the letter opener i saw earlier
its small but sharp enough to draw blood from the tip of my thumb
sucking the wound i pocket the weapon
its not much but its enough to stop me barricading myself in this room
feeling a touch more confident i head for my bedroom
without the guests to distract from the décor blackheath is a melancholy pile indeed
aside from the magnificent entrance hall the other rooms i pass through are musty thick with mildew and decay
pellets of rat poison have been piled up in the corners dust covering any surface too high for a maids short arm to reach
the rugs are threadbare the furniture scratched the smeared silver crockery arranged behind the dirty glass of display cabinets
as unpleasant as my fellow guests seem i miss the thrum of their conversations
theyre the lifeblood of this place filling up the spaces where otherwise this grim silence would fall
blackheaths only alive so long as people are in it
without them its a depressing ruin waiting on the mercy of a wrecking ball
i collect my coat and umbrella from my bedroom and make my way outside where rain is bouncing off the ground the air smothered by the stink of rotten leaves
uncertain of which window the bird crashed against i follow the verge until i locate its body and using the paperknife as a makeshift shovel i bury it in a shallow grave soaking my gloves in the process
already shivering i consider my route
the cobbled road to the stables skirts the bottom edge of the lawn
i could cut across the grass but my shoes seem ill suited to the venture
instead i take the safer option following the gravel driveway until the road appears on my left
unsurprisingly its in a terrible state of repair
tree roots have overturned the stones untrimmed branches hang low like pilfering fingers
still unsettled by my meeting with the strange man in the plague doctor costume i clutch the paperknife and move slowly wary of losing my footing afraid of what might spring out at me from the woods if i do
im not sure what his game is dressing up like that but i cant seem to shrug off his warnings
somebody murdered anna and gave me a compass
its doubtful that same person attacked me last night only to save me this morning and now i must contend with this footman
who must i have been to assemble so many enemies
at the end of the road is a tall redbrick arch with a shattered glass clock at the centre and beyond that a courtyard stables and outbuildings arranged around its edge
troughs overflow with oats and carriages stand wheel to wheel draped in green canvas covers to keep the weather off
the only things missing are the horses
every stable is empty
hello i call out tentatively my voice echoing around the yard but meeting no response
a plume of black smoke is escaping from the chimney of a little cottage and finding the door unlocked i chase my hollered greetings inside
no ones home which is curious as a fires burning in the hearth porridge and toast laid out on the table
removing my soggy gloves i hang them on the kettle pole above the fire hoping to spare myself a little discomfort on the walk back
touching the food with a fingertip i discover its lukewarm so not long abandoned
a saddle lies discarded beside a leather patch suggesting an interrupted repair
i can only assume whoever lives here has rushed out to deal with some emergency and i consider waiting for them to return
its not an unpleasant refuge though the airs thick with burning coal and smells rather strongly of polish and horsehair
of greater concern is the cottages isolation
until i know who attacked me last night everybody in blackheath must be treated with caution including the stablemaster
i will not meet him alone if it can be helped
a work rota hangs on a nail by the door a pencil dangling from a piece of string beside it
taking it down i turn the sheet over intending to leave a message requesting a ride to the village but theres a note already written there
dont leave blackheath more lives than your own are depending on you
meet me by the mausoleum in the family graveyard at 1020 pm and ill explain everything
oh and dont forget your gloves theyre burning
love anna  smoke fills my nostrils and i swing round to see my gloves smouldering above the fire
snatching them down i stamp the ashes out eyes wide and heart pounding as i search the cottage for some indication as to how the trick might have come to pass
why dont you ask anna when you meet her tonight
because i saw her die i snarl at the empty room embarrassing myself
recovering my composure i read the note once more the truth of it no nearer at hand
if annas survived shed have to be a cruel creature to play such games with me
more likely after word of this mornings misadventure spread around the house somebody has decided to play a trick on me
why else would they choose such a sinister location and hour for the meeting
is this somebody a fortune teller
its a foul day anybody could have predicted id dry my gloves once i arrived  the cottage listens politely but even to my ears that reasonings desperate
almost as desperate as my urge to discredit the message
so defective is my character id happily abandon any hope of anna being alive in order to flee this place with a clean conscience
feeling miserable i pull on my singed gloves
i need to think and walking seems to help
heading around the stables i come upon an overgrown paddock the grass grown waist high and the fences so badly rotted theyve all but collapsed
on the far side two figures huddle beneath an umbrella
they must be following a hidden path as theyre moving easily arminarm
heaven knows how they spot me but one of them raises a hand in greeting
i return the gesture sparking a brief moment of distant kinship before they disappear into the gloom of the trees
lowering my hand i make my decision
i told myself that a dead woman could lay no claim to me and thats why i was free to leave blackheath
it was a cowards reason but at least it had a ring of truth to it
if annas alive thats no longer the case
i failed her this morning and its all ive thought about since
now that i have a second chance i cannot turn my back
shes in danger and i can help so i must
if thats not enough to keep me at blackheath i dont deserve the life im so fearful of losing
come what may i must be in the graveyard at 1020 pm      6   somebody wants me dead  it feels strange to say it out loud as though im calling fate down upon myself but if im to survive until this evening ill need to face down this fear
i refuse to spend any more time cowering in my bedroom
not while there are so many questions to answer
im walking back to the house scouring the trees for any sign of danger my mind running back and forth across the mornings events
over and over again i wonder about the slashes on my arm and the man in the plague doctor costume the footman and this mysterious anna who now appears to be alive and well and leaving enigmatic notes for me to find
how did she survive in the forest
i suppose she could have written the note earlier this morning before she was attacked but then how did she know id be in that cottage drying my gloves over the fire
i didnt tell anybody about my plans
did i speak out loud
could she have been watching
shaking my head i take a step away from that particular rabbit hole
im looking too far forward when i need to be looking back
michael told me that a maid delivered a note to the dinner table last night and that was the last he saw of me
everything started with that
you need to find the servant who brought the note
im barely through blackheaths doors when voices pull me towards the drawing room which is empty aside from a couple of young maids clearing the lunchtime detritus onto two huge trays
they work side by side heads bowed in hushed gossip oblivious to my presence at the door
 henrietta said shed gone mad says one girl brown curls tumbling free of her white cap
its not right to say that about lady helena beth scolds the older girl
shes always been good to us treated us fair hasnt she  beth weighs this fact against the wealth of her gossip
henrietta told me she was raving she continues
screaming at lord peter
said it was probably on account of being back in blackheath after what happened to master thomas
does funny things to a person she said  she says a lot of things does henrietta id put them out of your mind
not like we havent heard them fighting before is it
besides if it were serious lady helena would tell mrs drudge wouldnt she
always does  mrs drudge cant find her says beth triumphantly the case against lady helena well and truly proven
hasnt seen her all morning but  my entrance slaps the words out of the air the maids attempting startled curtsies that swiftly devolve into a tangle of arms legs and blushes
waving away their confusion i ask after the servants who served dinner last night prompting only blank stares and mumbled apologies
im on the verge of giving up when beth ventures that evelyn hardcastle is entertaining the ladies in the sun room towards the rear of the house and would certainly know more
after a brief exchange one of them leads me through a communicating door into the study where i met daniel and michael this morning
theres a library beyond it which we cross briskly exiting the room into a dim connecting passage
darkness stirs to greet us a black cat drifting out from beneath a small telephone table its tail dusting the wooden floor
on silent feet it pads up the corridor slipping through a door left slightly ajar at the far end
a warm orange light is seeping through the gap voices and music on the other side
miss evelyns in there sir says the maid
her tone succinctly describes both the room and evelyn hardcastle neither of which she seems to hold in particularly high regard
brushing off her scorn i open the door the heat of the room hitting me full in the face
the air is heavy sweet with perfume stirred only by a scratchy music that soars and glides and stuns itself against the walls
large leaded windows look out over the garden at the rear of the house grey clouds piling up beyond a cupola
chairs and chaise longues have been gathered around the fire young women draped over them like wilted orchids smoking cigarettes and clinging to their drinks
the mood in the room is one of restless agitation rather than celebration
about the only sign of life comes from an oil painting on the far wall where an old woman with coals for eyes sits in judgement of the room her expression rather eloquently conveying her distaste for this gathering
my grandmother heather hardcastle says a woman from behind me
its not a flattering picture but then she wasnt a flattering woman by all accounts  i turn to meet the voice reddening as a dozen faces swim up through their boredom to inspect me
my name runs laps of the room a sudden excited buzz chasing it like a swarm of bees
sitting either side of a chess table are a woman i must assume to be evelyn hardcastle and an elderly extremely fat man wearing a suit thats a size too small for him
theyre an odd couple
evelyns in her late twenties and rather resembles a shard of glass with her thin angular body and high cheekbones her blonde hair tied up away from her face
shes wearing a green dress fashionably tailored and belted at the waist its sharp lines mirroring the severe expression on her face
as for the fat man he cant be less than sixtyfive and i can only imagine what contortions must have been necessary to persuade his enormous bulk behind the table
his chairs too small for him too stiff
hes a martyr to it
sweat is gleaming on his forehead the soaking wet handkerchief clutched in his hand testifying to the duration of his suffering
hes looking at me queerly an expression somewhere between curiosity and gratitude
my apologies i say
i was  evelyn slides a pawn forward without looking up from the board
the fat man returns his attention to the game engulfing his knight with a fleshy fingertip
i surprise myself by groaning at his mistake
you know chess evelyn asks me her eyes still fixed on the board
it appears so i say
then perhaps you would play after lord ravencourt  ignorant of my warning ravencourts knight swaggers into evelyns trap only to be cut down by a lurking rook
panic takes hold of his play as evelyn urges her pieces forward hurrying him when he should be patient
the games over in four moves
thank you for the diversion lord ravencourt says evelyn as he topples his king
now i believe you had somewhere else to be  its a curt dismissal and with an awkward bow ravencourt disentangles himself from the table and limps out of the room offering me the slightest of nods on the way
evelyns distaste chases him through the door but it evaporates as she gestures to the seat opposite
please she says
im afraid i cant i say
im looking for a maid who brought me a message at the dinner table last night but i know nothing more of her
i was hoping you could help  our butler could she says restoring the pieces of her bedraggled army to their line
each is placed precisely at the centre of a square its face turned towards the enemy
clearly theres no place for cowards on this board
mr collins knows every step every servant takes in this house or so he leads them to believe she says
unfortunately he was assaulted this morning
doctor dickie had him moved to the gatehouse so he could rest more comfortably
ive actually been meaning to look in on him myself perhaps i could escort you  i momentarily hesitate weighing the danger
one can only assume that if evelyn hardcastle intended me harm she wouldnt announce our intention to go off together in front of an entire room of witnesses
that would be very kind i respond earning a flicker of a smile
evelyn stands either not noticing or pretending not to notice the curious glances nudging us
there are french doors onto the gardens but we forgo them departing instead from the entrance hall so we might collect our coats and hats from our bedrooms first
evelyns still tugging hers on as we step out of blackheath into the blustery cold afternoon
may i ask what happened to mr collins i say wondering if perhaps his assault might be linked to my own last night
apparently he was set upon by one of our guests an artist named gregory gold she says knotting her thick scarf
it was an unprovoked attack by all accounts and gold managed to thrash him pretty soundly before somebody intervened
i should warn you doctor mr collins has been heavily sedated so im not sure how helpful hell be  were following the gravel driveway that leads to the village and once again im struck by the peculiarity of my condition
at some point in the last few days i must have arrived along this very road happy and excited or perhaps annoyed at the distance and isolation
did i understand the danger i was in or did it come later during my stay
so much of me is lost memories simply blown aside like the leaves on the ground and yet here i stand remade
i wonder if sebastian bell would approve of this man ive become
if wed even get along
without a word evelyn links an arm through my own a warm smile transforming her face
its as though a fire has been kindled within her eyes sparkling with life banishing the shrouded woman of earlier
its so good to be out of that house she cries tipping her face to meet the rain
thank goodness you came along when you did doctor
honestly a minute later and youd have found me with my head in the grate  lucky i stopped by then i say somewhat startled by her change in mood
sensing my confusion evelyn laughs lightly
oh dont mind me she says
i loathe getting to know people so whenever i meet somebody i like i just assume a friendship immediately
it saves a great deal of time in the long run  i can see the appeal i say
may i ask what i did to earn a favourable impression  only if you allow me to be frank in my answer  youre not being frank now  i was trying to be polite but youre right i never seem to land on the right side of the fence she says with mock regret
well to be frank i like your pensiveness doctor
you strike me as a man whod much rather be somewhere else a feeling i can wholeheartedly sympathise with  am i to assume youre not enjoying your homecoming  oh this hasnt been my home in a very long time she says skipping over a large puddle
ive lived in paris for the last nineteen years ever since my brother was killed  what about the women i saw you with in the sun room are they not your friends  they arrived this morning and truth be told i didnt recognise a single one of them
the children i knew have shed their skins and slithered into society
im as much a stranger here as yourself  at least youre not a stranger to yourself miss hardcastle i say
surely you can take some solace in that  quite the contrary she says looking at me
i imagine it would be rather splendid to wander away from myself for a little while
i envy you  envy  why not she says wiping the rain from her face
youre a soul stripped bare doctor
no regrets no wounds none of the lies we tell ourselves so we can look in the mirror each morning
youre – she bites her lip searching for the word – honest  another word for that is “exposed” i say
am i to take it youre not enjoying your homecoming  theres a crook in her smile a slight twist of the lips that could easily be damning yet somehow comes across as conspiratorial
im not the man id hoped to be i say quietly surprised by my own candour
something about this woman puts me at ease though for the life of me i cant tell what it is
how so she asks
im a coward miss hardcastle i sigh
forty years of memories wiped away and thats what i find lurking beneath it all
thats what remains to me  oh do call me evie that way i can call you sebastian and tell you not to fret about your flaws
we all have them and if i were newly born into this world i might be cautious too she says squeezing my arm
youre very kind but this is something deeper instinctive  well so what if you are she asks
there are worse things to be
at least youre not meanspirited or cruel
and now you get to choose dont you
instead of assembling yourself in the dark like the rest of us – so that you wake up one day with no idea of how you became this person – you can look at the world at the people around you and choose the parts of your character you want
you can say “ill have that mans honesty that womans optimism” as if youre shopping for a suit on saville row  youve made my condition into a gift i say feeling my spirits lift
well what else would you call a second chance she asks
you dont like the man you were very well be somebody else
theres nothing stopping you not any more
as i said i envy you
the rest of us are stuck with our mistakes  i have no response to that though one is not immediately required
weve arrived upon two giant fence posts fractured angels blaring their noiseless horns on top
the gatehouse is set back among the trees on our left splashes of its redtile roof showing through the dense canopy
a path leads towards a peeling green door which is swollen with age and riddled with cracks
ignoring it evelyn pulls me by the fingers towards the back of the house pushing through branches so overgrown theyre touching the crumbling brickwork
the back door is held fast with a simple latch and undoing it she lets us into a dank kitchen a layer of dust coating the countertops the copper pans still out on the hob
once inside she pauses listening intently
evelyn i say
motioning for quiet she takes a step closer to the corridor
unsettled by this sudden caution my body tenses but she breaks the spell with laughter
im sorry sebastian i was listening out for my father  your father i say puzzled
hes staying here she says
hes supposed to be out hunting but i didnt want to risk bumping into him if he was running late
im afraid we dont like each other terribly much  before i have the chance to ask any more questions she beckons me into a tiled hallway and up a narrow staircase the bare wooden steps shrieking beneath our feet
i keep to her heels snatching backward glances every few steps
the gatehouse is narrow and crooked doors set into the walls at odd angles like teeth grown wild in a mouth
wind whistles through the windows carrying with it the smell of the rain the entire place seeming to rattle on its foundations
everything about this house seems designed to unseat the nerves
why put the butler all the way out here i ask evelyn whos trying to choose between the doors either side of us
there must have been somewhere more comfortable  all the rooms in the main house are full and doctor dickie ordered peace and quiet and a good fire
believe it or not this might be the best place for him
come on lets try this one she says rapping lightly on a door to our left pushing it open when theres no response
a tall fellow in a charcoalstained shirt is bound by his wrists and dangling from a hook on the ceiling his feet only barely touching the floor
hes unconscious a head full of dark curly hair slumped against his chest blood speckling his face
nope must be the other side says evelyn her voice bland and unconcerned
what the devil i say taking a step back in alarm
who is this man evelyn  this is gregory gold the fellow who assaulted our butler says evelyn eyeing him as one would a butterfly pinned to a corkboard
the butler was my fathers batman during the war
seems fathers taken the assault rather personally  personally i say
evie hes been strung up like a pig  fathers never been a subtle man or a particularly clever one she shrugs
i suspect the two things go hand in hand  for the first time since i awoke my blood is boiling
whatever this mans crimes justice cant be served by a length of rope in a locked room
we cant leave him like this i protest
its inhuman  what he did was inhuman says evelyn her chill touching me for the first time
mother commissioned gold to tidy up a few of the family portraits nothing more
he didnt even know the butler and yet this morning he took after him with a poker and beat him half to death
believe me sebastian he deserves worse than whats happening to him here  whats to become of him i ask
a constable is coming from the village says evelyn ushering me out of the small room and closing the door behind us her mood brightening immediately
father wants to let gold know of his displeasure in the meantime thats all
ah this must be the one we wanted  she opens another door on the opposite side of the hall and we enter a small room with whitewashed walls and a single window blinded by dirt
unlike the rest of the house theres no draught in here and a good fires burning in the grate plenty of wood stacked nearby to feed it
theres an iron bed in the corner the butler shapeless beneath a grey blanket
i recognise this chap
its the burnt man who let me in this morning
evelyn was right hes been cruelly treated
his face is hideously bruised and livid with cuts dried blood staining the pillowcase
i might have mistaken him for dead if it werent for his constant murmuring distress poisoning his sleep
a maid is sitting beside him in a wooden chair a large book open in her lap
she cant be more than twentythree small enough to tuck into a pocket with blonde hair spilling from beneath her cap
she looks up as we enter slamming the book closed and leaping to her feet when she realises who we are hastily smoothing out her white apron
miss evelyn she stammers eyes on the floor
i didnt know youd be visiting  my friend here needed to see mr collins says evelyn
the maids brown eyes flick towards me before pinning themselves to the ground once more
im sorry miss he hasnt stirred all morning says the maid
the doctor gave him some tablets to help him sleep  and he cant be woken  havent tried miss but you made an awful racket coming up them stairs and he didnt bat an eyelid
dont know what else would do it if that didnt
dead to the world he is  the maids eyes find me once again lingering long enough to suggest some sort of familiarity before resuming their former contemplation of the floor
im sorry but do we know each other i ask
no sir not really its just
i served you at dinner last night  did you bring me a note i ask excitedly
not me sir it was madeline  madeline  my ladys maid interrupts evelyn
the house was shortstaffed so i sent her down to the kitchen to help out
well thats fortunate – she checks her wristwatch – shes taking refreshments out to the hunters but shell be back around three pm we can question her together when she returns  i turn my attention back to the maid
do you know anything more about the note i ask
its contents perhaps  the maid shakes her head wringing her hands
the poor creature looks quite on the spot and taking pity on her i offer my thanks and leave
7   were following the road to the village the trees drawing closer with every step
its not quite what id anticipated
the map in the study conjured images of some grand labour a boulevard hewn from the forest
the reality is little more than a wide dirt track wretched with potholes and fallen branches
the forest hasnt been tamed so much as bartered with the hardcastles winning the barest of concessions from their neighbour
i dont know our destination but evelyn believes we can intercept madeline on her way back from the hunt
secretly i suspect shes simply looking for an excuse to prolong her absence from the house
not that any subterfuge is necessary
this last hour in evelyns company is the first time since waking that ive felt myself a whole person rather than the remnants of one
out here in the wind and rain with a friend by my side im happier than i have been all day
what do you believe madeline can tell you asks evelyn picking a branch off the path and tossing it into the forest
the note that she brought me last night lured me out into the woods so somebody could attack me i say
attack interrupts evelyn shocked
here
why  i dont know but im hoping madeline can tell me who sent the note
she might even have peeked at the message  theres no “might” about it says evelyn
madeline was in paris with me
shes loyal and she makes me laugh but shes an atrocious maid
she probably considers peeking at other peoples mail a perk of the job  thats very lenient of you i say
i have to be i cant pay very well she says
and after shes revealed the contents of the message what then  i tell the police i say
and hopefully put this matter to bed  turning left at a crooked signpost we follow a small trail into the woods dirt tracks crisscrossing each other until the way back is impossible to discern
do you know where youre going i ask nervously swiping a lowhanging branch from my face
the last time i entered this forest my mind never made it back
were following these she says tugging at a fragment of yellow material nailed to a tree
its similar to the red one i found when i stumbled upon blackheath this morning the memory only serving to unsettle me further
theyre markers she says
the groundskeepers use them to navigate in the woods
dont worry ill not lead you too far astray  the words are barely out of her mouth when we enter a small clearing with a stone well at its centre
the wooden shelter has collapsed the iron wheel that once raised the bucket now left to rust in the mud almost buried by fallen leaves
evelyn claps in delight laying an affectionate hand on the mossy stone
shes clearly hoping i havent noticed the slip of paper tucked between the cracks or the way her fingers are now covering it
friendship compels me to play along and i hastily avert my attention when she looks back towards me
she must have some suitor in the house and im ashamed to say im jealous of this secret correspondence and the person on the other side of it
this is it she says with a theatrical sweep of her arm
madeline will be passing through this clearing on her way back to the house
shouldnt be too long now
shes due back at the house by three to help finish setting up the ballroom  where are we i ask looking around
its a wishing well she says leaning over the edge to peer into the blackness
michael and i used to come here when we children
wed make our wishes with pebbles  and what sorts of things did young evelyn hardcastle wish for i ask
she wrinkles her brow the question flummoxing her
you know for the life of me i cant remember she says
what does a child who has everything want  more just like everybody else
i doubt i could have told you even when i did have my memories i say smiling
dusting the grime from her hands evelyn looks at me quizzically
i can see the curiosity burning inside her the joy at encountering something unknown and unexpected in a place where everything is familiar
im out here because i fascinate her i realise with a flash of disappointment
have you thought about what youll do if your memories dont return she asks softening the question with the gentleness of her tone
now its my turn to be flummoxed
since my initial confusion passed ive tried not to dwell upon my condition
if anything the loss of my memories has proven a frustration rather than a tragedy my inability to recall anna being one of the few moments when its seemed anything more than an inconvenience
thus far in the excavation of sebastian bell ive unearthed two friends an annotated bible and a locked trunk
precious little return for forty years on this earth
i dont have a wife weeping for our lost time together or a child worrying that the father she loved might not return
at this distance sebastian bells life seems an easy one to lose and a difficult one to mourn
a branch snaps somewhere in the forest
footman says evelyn my blood immediately running cold as i recall the plague doctors warning
what did you say i ask frantically searching the forest
that noise its a footman she says
theyre collecting wood
shameful isnt it
we dont have enough servants to stock all the fireplaces so our guests are having to send their own footmen to do it  they
how many are there  one for every family visiting and theres more coming she says
id say theres already seven or eight in the house  eight i say in a strangled voice
my dear sebastian are you quite all right says evelyn catching my alarm
under different circumstances i would welcome this concern this affection but here and now her scrutiny only embarrasses me
how can i explain that a strange chap in a plague doctor costume warned me to keep an eye out for a footman – a name which means nothing to me and yet fills me with a crippling fear every time i hear it
im sorry evie i say shaking my head ruefully
theres more i need to tell you but not here and not quite yet  unable to hold her questioning stare i look around the clearing for a distraction
three trails intersect before striking off into the forest one of them cutting a straight path through the trees towards water
is that  a lake says evelyn looking past me
the lake i suppose youd say
thats where my brother was murdered by charlie carver  a shiver of silence divides us
im sorry evie i say at last embarrassed by the poverty of the sentiment
youll think me awful but it happened so long ago it barely seems real she says
i cant even remember thomass face  michael shared a similar sentiment i say
thats not surprising he was five years younger than me when it happened shes hugging herself her tone distant
i was supposed to be looking after thomas that morning but i wanted to go riding and he was always pestering me so i arranged a treasure hunt for the children and left him behind
if i hadnt been so selfish hed never have been at the lake in the first place and carver wouldnt have got his filthy hands on him
you cant imagine what that thought does to a child
i didnt sleep barely ate
i couldnt feel anything that wasnt anger or guilt
i was monstrous to anybody who tried to console me  what changed  michael – she smiles wistfully – i was vile to him positively horrid but he stayed by my side no matter what i said
he saw i was sad and he wanted to make me feel better
i dont even think he knew what was happening not really
he was just being nice but he kept me from drifting away completely  is that why you went to paris to get away from it all  i didnt choose to leave my parents sent me away a few months after it happened she says biting her lip
they couldnt forgive me and i wouldnt have been allowed to forgive myself if id stayed
i know it was supposed to be a punishment but exile was a kindness i think  and yet you came back  you make it sound like a choice she says bitterly tightening her scarf as the wind carves through the trees
my parents ordered my return they even threatened to cut me out of the will should i refuse
when that didnt work they threatened to cut michael out of the will instead
so here i am  i dont understand why would they behave so despicably and then throw you a party  a party she says shaking her head
oh my dear man you really have no idea whats happening here do you  perhaps if you  my brother was murdered nineteen years ago tomorrow sebastian
i dont know why but my parents have decided to mark the occasion by reopening the house where it happened and inviting back the very same guests who were here that day  anger is rising in her voice a low throb of pain id do anything to make go away
shes turned her head to face the lake her blue eyes glossy
theyre disguising a memorial as a party and theyve made me the guest of honour which i can only assume means something dreadful is coming for me she continues
this isnt a celebration its a punishment and therell be fifty people in their very finest clothes watching it happen  are your parents really so spiteful i ask shocked
i feel much as i did when that bird hit the window earlier this morning a great swell of pity mingled with a sense of injustice at lifes sudden cruelties
my mother sent me a message this morning asking me to meet her by the lake she says
she never came and i dont think she ever meant to
she just wanted me to stand out there where it happened remembering
does that answer your question  evelyn
i
i dont know what to say  theres nothing to say sebastian
wealth is poisonous to the soul and my parents have been wealthy a very long time – as have most of the guests who will be at this party says evelyn
their manners are a mask youd do well to remember that  she smiles at my pained expression taking my hand
her fingers are cold her gaze warm
she has the brittle courage of a prisoner walking their final steps to the gallows
oh dont fret dear heart she says
ive done all the tossing and turning its possible to do
i see little benefit in your losing sleep over it also
if you want you could make a wish in the well on my behalf though id understand if you have more pressing concerns  from her pocket she pulls out a small coin
here she says handing it to me
i dont think our pebbles did much good  the coin travels a long way hitting rock rather than water at the bottom
despite evelyns advice i hitch no hopes for myself to its surface
instead i pray for her deliverance from this place for a happy life and freedom from her parents machinations
like a child i close my eyes in the hopes that when i open them again the natural order will be overturned the impossible made plausible by desire alone
youve changed so much mutters evelyn a ripple of emotion disturbing her face the slightest indication of discomfort when she realises what shes said
you knew me before i say surprised
somehow it never occurred to me that evelyn and i might have had a relationship prior to this one
i shouldnt have said anything she says walking away from me
evie ive been in your company for over an hour which makes you my best friend in this world i say
please be honest with me
who am i  her eyes crisscross my face
im not the right person to say she protests
we met two days ago and only briefly
most of what i know is innuendo and rumour  im sitting at an empty table ill take whatever crumbs im fed  her lips are tight
shes tugging her sleeves down awkwardly
if she had a shovel shed dig herself an escape tunnel
the deeds of good men are not related so reluctantly and im already beginning to dread what she has to tell me
even so i cannot let this go
please i plead
you told me earlier i could choose who i wanted to be but i cannot do that without knowing who i was  her obstinacy flickers and she looks up at me from under her eyelashes
are you certain you wish to know she asks
the truth isnt always a kindness  kind or not i need to understand whats been lost  not a great deal in my opinion she sighs squeezing my hand in both of hers
you were a dope dealer sebastian
you made your living alleviating the boredom of the idle rich and quite a living it was too if your practice on harley street is anything to go by  im a  dope dealer she repeats
laudanums the fashion i believe though from what i understand your trunk of tricks has something to cater to every taste  i slump within myself
i wouldnt have believed i could be so wounded by the past but the revelation of my former profession tears a hole right through me
though my failings were numerous against them was always stacked the small pride of being a doctor
there was nobility in that course honour even
but no sebastian bell took the title and twisted it to his own selfish ends making it perverse denying what little good remained to him
evelyn was right the truth isnt always a kindness but no man should discover himself this way like an abandoned house stumbled upon in the darkness
i shouldnt worry about it says evelyn cocking her head to catch my averted eye
i see little of that odious creature in the man before me  is that why im at this party i ask quietly
to sell my wares  her smile is sympathetic
i suspect so  im numb two steps behind myself
every strange glance over the course of the day every whisper and commotion as i walked into a room is explained
i thought people were concerned for my wellbeing but they were wondering when my trunk would reopen for business
i feel such a fool
i have to  im moving before i understand how that sentence ends my body carrying me back through the forest at an ever increasing pace
im almost running by the time i arrive on the road
evelyns at my heels struggling to keep up
shes trying to anchor me with words reminding me of my desire to meet madeline but im impervious to reason consumed by my hatred for the man i was
his flaws i could accept perhaps even overcome but this is a betrayal
he made his mistakes and fled leaving me holding the tatters of his scorched life
blackheaths door stands open and im up the staircase and into my room so quickly the smell of damp earth still clings to me as i stand panting over the trunk
is this what drove me into the forest last night
is this what i spilled blood for
well im going to smash it all and with it any connection to the man i was
evelyn arrives to find me ransacking my bedroom for something heavy enough to break the lock
intuiting my purpose she ducks into the corridor returning with the bust of some roman emperor or other
youre a treasure i say using it to hammer the lock
when i yanked the trunk out of the cupboard this morning it was so heavy it took all my strength to lift but now its sliding backwards with each blow
once again evelyn comes to the rescue sitting on the trunk to keep it in place and after three enormous strikes the lock clatters to the floor
tossing the bust on the bed i lift the heavy lid
the trunks empty
or at least mostly empty
in a dark corner is a solitary chess piece with annas name carved into the base
i think its time you told me the rest of your story says evelyn
8   darkness presses up against my bedroom window its cold breath leaving frost on the glass
the fire hisses in response the swaying flames my only light
steps hurry down the corridor beyond my closed door a jumble of voices on their way to the ball
somewhere in the distance i hear the tremble of a violin coming awake
stretching my feet towards the fire i wait for silence
evelyn asked me to attend both dinner and the party but i cant mingle with these people knowing who i am and what it is they really want from me
im tired of this house their games
im going to meet anna at 1020 pm in the graveyard and then ill have a stable hand take us to the village away from this madness
my gaze returns to the chess piece i found in the trunk
im holding it up to the light in the hopes of worrying loose some further memories
thus far its kept quiet and theres little about the piece itself to illuminate my memory
its a bishop handcarved and freckled with white paint a far cry from the expensive ivory sets ive seen around the house and yet it means something to me
regardless of any memory theres a feeling associated with it a sense of comfort almost
holding it brings me courage
theres a knock on the door my hand tightening around the chess piece as i start from the chair
the closer i come to the meeting in the graveyard the more highly strung ive become practically leaping out of the window every time the fire pops in the grate
belly you in there asks michael hardcastle
he knocks again
its insistent
a polite battering ram
placing the chess piece on the mantel above the fireplace i open the door
the halls awash with people in costume michael wearing a bright orange suit and fiddling with the straps of a giant sun mask
there you are he says frowning at me
why arent you dressed yet  im not coming i say
its been  a wave towards my head but my sign language is too vague for him
are you feeling faint he asks
should i call dickie
i just saw him  i have to catch michaels arm to prevent him from flying off down the corridor in search of the doctor
i simply dont feel up to it i say
are you sure
there are going to be fireworks and im certain my parents have been cooking up a surprise all day
seems a shame to  honestly id rather not  if youre certain he says reluctantly his voice as crestfallen as his face
im sorry youve had such a wretched day belly
heres hoping tomorrow will be better with fewer misunderstandings at least  misunderstandings i say
the murdered girl he smiles in confusion
daniel told me it was all a big mistake
i felt a right bloody fool calling off the search halfway through
no harm done though  daniel
how could he possibly have known anna was alive
it was a mistake wasnt it he asks noting my bafflement
of course i say brightly
yes terrible mistake
im sorry to have bothered you with it  not to worry he says slightly dubiously
think no more about it  his words are stretched thin like overburdened elastic
i can hear his doubt not only in the story but in the man standing before him
after all im not the person he knew and i think hes coming to realise that i no longer wish to be
this morning id have done almost anything to repair the fracture between us but sebastian bell was a drug peddler and a coward the consort of vipers
michael was a friend of that man so how could he ever be a friend of mine
well id best be off he says clearing his throat
feel better old man  rapping the doorframe with his knuckle he turns away following the rest of the guests on their way to the party
i watch him go digesting the news
id quite forgotten about annas flight through the woods this morning our imminent meeting in the graveyard sapping much of the horror from my first memory
and yet something momentous clearly happened even if daniel has been telling people it didnt
im certain of what i witnessed the gunshot and the fear
anna was chased by a figure in black whom i must now assume to have been the footman
somehow she survived as did i after my assault last night
is that what she wants to talk about
our mutual enemy and why he wants us dead
perhaps hes after the drugs
theyre clearly valuable
maybe annas my partner and she removed them from the trunk to keep them out of his hands
that would at least explain the presence of the chess piece
maybe its some sort of calling card
after taking my coat from the wardrobe i wrap myself in a long scarf and slip my hands into a thick pair of gloves pocketing the paperknife and chess piece on the way out
im rewarded by a crisp cold night
as my eyes adjust to the gloom i breathe in the fresh air still damp with the storm and follow the gravel path around the house towards the graveyard
my shoulders are tense my stomach unsettled
im frightened of this forest but im more frightened by this meeting
when i first awoke i wanted nothing more than to rediscover myself but last nights misadventure now seems a blessing
injury has given me the chance to start again but what if meeting anna brings all my old memories flooding back
can this higgledypiggledy personality ive cobbled together over the course of the day survive such a deluge or will it be washed away entirely
will i be washed away
the thought is almost enough to turn me around by the shoulders but i cannot confront the person i was by running from the life he built
better to make a stand here confident of whom i wish to become
gritting my teeth i follow the path through the trees coming upon a small gardeners cottage the windows dark
evelyns leaning against the wall smoking a cigarette a lantern burning by her feet
shes wearing a long beige coat and wellington boots an outfit somewhat at odds with the blue evening dress beneath it and the diamond tiara sparkling in her hair
shes really quite beautiful though she carries it awkwardly
she notices me noticing
i didnt have time to change after dinner she says defensively tossing her cigarette away
what are you doing here evie i ask
youre supposed to be at the ball  i slipped away
you didnt think id miss all the fun she says grinding the cigarette beneath her heel
its dangerous  then it would be foolish for you to go alone besides i brought some help  from her handbag she pulls out a black revolver
where on earth did you find that i ask feeling shocked and slightly guilty
the idea that my problem has put a weapon in evelyns hand seems like a betrayal somehow
she should be warm and safe in blackheath not out here in harms way
its my mothers so the better question might be where she found it  evie you cant  sebastian youre my only friend in this dreadful place and im not going to let you stroll into a graveyard alone without knowing whats waiting for you
somebodys already tried to kill you once
i have no intention of letting them try again  a lump of gratitude lodges itself in my throat
thank you  dont be silly its either this or i stay in that house with everybodys eyes upon me she says lifting the lantern into the air
i should be thanking you
now shall we go
therell be hell to pay if im not back for the speeches  darkness weighs heavy on the graveyard the iron fence buckled trees bent low over crooked gravestones
thick piles of rotting leaves smother the plots the tombs cracked and crumbling taking the names of the dead with them
i spoke with madeline about the note you received last night says evelyn pushing open the squeaking gate and leading us inside
i hope you dont mind  of course i dont i say looking around nervously
it slipped my mind truth be told
what did she say  only that the note was given to her by mrs drudge the cook
i spoke to her separately and she told me it had been left in the kitchen though she couldnt say by whom
there was too much coming and going  and did madeline read it i ask
of course says evelyn wryly
she didnt even blush when she admitted to it
the message was very brief it asked you to come immediately to the usual spot  that was all
no signature  im afraid not
im sorry sebastian id hoped to have better news  weve reached the mausoleum at the far end of the graveyard a large marble box watched over by two broken angels
a lantern hangs from one of their beckoning hands and though it flickers in the gloom theres nothing of note to illuminate
the graveyards empty
perhaps annas running a little late says evelyn
then who left the lantern burning i ask
my heart is racing damp seeping up my trousers as i wade through ankledeep leaves
evelyns watch assures us of the time but annas nowhere to be seen
theres just that damnable lantern squeaking as it sways in the breeze and for fifteen minutes or more we stand stiff beneath it the light draping our shoulders our eyes searching for anna and finding her everywhere in the shifting shadows and stirring leaves the lowhanging branches disturbed by the breeze
time and again one of us taps the other on the shoulder drawing their attention to a sudden sound or startled animal darting through the underbrush
as the hour grows later its difficult to keep ones thoughts from venturing to more frightening places
doctor dickie believed the wounds on my arms were defensive in nature as though id been fending off an assault with a knife
what if anna isnt an ally but an enemy
perhaps thats why her name was fixed in my mind
for all i know she penned the note i received at the dinner table and has now lured me out here to finish the job started yesterday evening
these thoughts spread like cracks through my already brittle courage fear pouring into the hollowness behind
only evelyns presence keeps me upright her own courage pinning me in place
i dont think shes coming says evelyn
no i rather think not i say speaking quietly to mask my relief
perhaps we should head back  i think so she says
im so sorry dear heart  with an unsteady hand i take the lantern down from the angels arm and follow evelyn towards the gate
weve only taken a couple of steps when evelyn clutches my arm lowering her flame towards the ground
light splashes the leaves revealing blood splattered across their surface
kneeling down i rub the sticky substance between my thumb and forefinger
here says evelyn quietly
shes followed the drips to a nearby tombstone where something glitters beneath the leaves
sweeping them aside i find the compass that led me out of the forest this morning
its bloodstained and shattered yet still unwavering in its devotion to north
is that the compass the killer gave you says evelyn her voice hushed
it is i say weighing it in my palm
daniel coleridge took it from me this morning  and then it appears somebody took it from him  whatever danger anna intended to warn me about it seems to have found her first and daniel coleridge was involved somehow
evelyn lays a hand on my shoulder as she squints warily into the darkness beyond the glow of the lantern
i think its best we get you out of blackheath she says
go to your room and ill send a carriage to fetch you  i have to find daniel i protest weakly
and anna  something awful is happening here she hisses
the slashes on your arm the drugs anna and now this compass
these are pieces in a game neither of us knows how to play
you must leave for me sebastian
let the police deal with all of this  i nod
ive not the will to fight
anna was the only reason i stayed in the first place the shreds of my courage convincing me there was some honour to be found in obeying a request delivered so cryptically
without that obligation the ties binding me to this place have been severed
we return to blackheath in silence evelyn leading the way her revolver poking at the darkness
i trail behind quietly little more than a dog at her heel and before i know it im saying goodbye to my friend and opening the door into my bedroom
all is not how i left it
theres a box sitting on my bed wrapped in a red ribbon that comes loose with a single tug
sliding away the lid my stomach flips bile rushing into my throat
stuffed inside is a dead rabbit with a carving knife stabbed through its body
blood has congealed at the bottom staining its fur and almost obscuring the note pinned to its ear
from your friend  the footman
black swims up into my eyes
a second later i faint
9   day two  a deafening clanging jolts me upright my hands flying to my ears
wincing i look around for the source of the noise to find ive been moved in the night
instead of the airy bedroom with the bathtub and welcoming fire im in a narrow room with whitewashed walls and a single iron bed dusty light poking through a small window
theres a chest of drawers on the opposite wall beside a ratty brown dressing gown hanging from a door peg
swinging my legs from the bed my feet touch cold stone a shiver dancing up my spine
after the dead rabbit i immediately suspect the footman of perpetrating some new devilry but this incessant noise is making it impossible to concentrate
i pull on the dressing gown nearly choking on the smell of cheap cologne and poke my head into the corridor beyond
cracked tiles cover the floor whitewashed walls ballooning out with damp
there are no windows only lamps staining everything with a dirty yellow light that never seems to settle
the clanging is louder out here and covering my ears i follow the din until i reach the bottom of a splintered wooden staircase leading up into the house
dozens of large tin bells are attached to a board on the wall each with a plaque beneath it naming a section of the house
the bell for the front door is shaking so hard im worried its going to unsettle the foundations
hands pressed to my ears i stare at the bell but short of ripping it from the wall theres no obvious way of quietening the clamour beyond answering the door
belting the dressing gown tight i rush up the stairs emerging at the rear of the entrance hall
its much quieter here the servants moving through in a calm procession their arms filled with bouquets of flowers and other decorations
i can only assume theyre too busy clearing away the detritus of last nights party to have heard the noise
with an annoyed shake of the head i open the door to find myself confronted by doctor sebastian bell
hes wildeyed and dripping wet shivering with cold
i need your help he says spitting panic
my world empties
do you have a telephone he continues the desperation terrible in his eyes
we need to send for the authorities  this is impossible
dont just stand there you devil he cries out shaking me by the shoulders the cold of his hands seeping through my pyjamas
unwilling to wait for a response he pushes past me into the entrance hall searching for aid
i try to make sense of what im seeing
this is me
this is me yesterday
somebody is speaking to me tugging on my sleeve but i cant focus on anything except the imposter dripping on the floor
daniel coleridge has appeared at the top of the staircase
sebastian he says descending with one hand on the banister
i watch him for the trick some flicker of rehearsal of jest but he pads down the steps exactly as he did yesterday just as light of foot just as confident and admired
theres another tug on my arm a maid placing herself in my eyeline
shes looking at me with concern her lips moving
blinking away my confusion i focus on her finally hearing what shes saying
 mr collins you all right mr collins  her face is familiar though i cant place it
i look over her head to the stairs where daniel is already ushering bell up to his room
everythings happening precisely as it did yesterday
pulling free of the maid i rush to a mirror on the wall
i can barely look at it
im badly burnt my skin mottled and rough to the touch like fruit left too long in the sweltering sun
i know this man
somehow ive awoken as the butler
my heart hammering i turn back to the maid
whats happening to me i stammer clutching at my throat surprised by the hoarse northern voice coming out of it
sir  how did  but im asking the wrong person
the answers are caked in dirt and trudging up the stairs to daniels room
picking up the edges of my dressing gown i hurry after them following a trail of leaves and muddy rainwater
the maid is calling my name
im halfway up when she bolts past me planting herself in the way with both hands pressed against my chest
you cant go up there mr collins she says
therell be merry hell to pay if lady helena catches you running around in your smalls  i try to go around her but she steps sideways blocking me again
let me pass girl i demand immediately regretting it
this isnt how i speak blunt and demanding
youre having one of your turns mr collins thats all she says
come down to the kitchen ill make us a pot of tea  her eyes are blue earnest
they flick over my shoulder selfconsciously and i look behind me to find other servants gathered at the bottom of the stairs
theyre watching us their arms still laden with flowers
one of my turns i ask doubt opening its mouth and swallowing me
on account of your burns mr collins she says quietly
sometimes you say things or see things that aint right
a cup of teas all it takes a few minutes and youre right as rain  her kindness is crushing warm and heavy
im reminded of daniels pleas yesterday his delicate way of speaking as though i might fracture if pressed too hard
he thought i was mad as this maid does now
given whats happening to me what i think is happening to me i cant be certain theyre wrong
i offer her a helpless look and she takes my arm guiding me back down the steps the crowd parting to let us through
cup of tea mr collins she says reassuringly
thats all you need  she leads me like a lost child the soft grip of her calloused hand as calming as her tone
together we leave the entrance hall heading back down the servants staircase and along the gloomy corridor into the kitchen
sweat stands up on my brow heat rushing out of ovens and stoves pots bubbling over open flames
i smell gravy roasted meats and baking cakes sugar and sweat
too many guests and too few working ovens thats the problem
theyve had to start preparing dinner now to make sure everything goes out on time later
the knowledge bewilders me
its true im certain of it but how could i know that unless i really am the butler
maids are rushing out carrying breakfast scrambled eggs and kippers heaped on silver platters
a widehipped ruddyfaced elderly woman is standing by the oven bellowing instructions her pinafore covered in flour
no general ever wore a chestful of medals with such conviction
somehow she spots us through the commotion her iron glare striking the maid first then myself
wiping her hands on her apron she strides over to us
im sure youve somewhere to be havent you lucy she says with a stern look
the maid hesitates considering the wisdom of objecting
yes mrs drudge  her hand releases me leaving a patch of emptiness on my arm
a sympathetic smile and shes gone lost among the din
sit yourself down roger says mrs drudge her tone aspiring to gentleness
she has a split lip bruising beginning to show around her mouth
somebody must have struck her and she winces when she speaks
theres a wooden table at the centre of the kitchen its surface covered in platters of tongue roasted chickens and hams piled high
there are soups and stews trays of glistening vegetables with more being added all the time by the harassed kitchen staff most of whom look to have spent an hour in the ovens themselves
pulling out a chair i sit down
mrs drudge slides a tray of scones from the oven putting one on a plate with a small curl of butter
she brings it over placing the plate in front of me and touching my hand
her skins hard as old leather
her gaze lingers kindness wrapped in thistle before she turns away bellowing her way back through the crowd
the scone is delicious the melting butter dripping off the sides
im only a bite into it when i see lucy again finally remembering why shes familiar
this is the maid who will be in the drawing room at lunchtime – the one who will be abused by ted stanwin and rescued by daniel coleridge
shes even prettier than i recall with freckles and large blue eyes red hair straying from beneath her cap
shes trying to open a jam jar her face screwed up with effort
she had jam stains all over her apron
it happens in slow motion the jar slipping from her hands and hitting the floor glass spraying across the kitchen her apron splattered with dripping jam
oh bloody hell lucy harper somebody cries dismayed
my chair clatters to the floor as i dart from the kitchen racing down the corridor and back upstairs
im in such a rush that as i turn the corner onto the guest corridor i collide with a wiry chap curly black hair spilling down his brow charcoal staining his white shirt
apologising i look up into the face of gregory gold
fury wears him like a suit his eyes empty of all reason
hes livid trembling with rage and only too late do i remember what comes next how the butler looked after this monster did his work
i attempt to back away but he takes hold of my dressing gown with his long fingers
you dont need  my vision blurs the world reduced to a smudge of colour and a flash of pain as i crash into a wall then drop to the floor blood trickling from my head
hes looming over me an iron poker in his hand
please i say trying to slide backwards away from him
im not  he kicks me in the side emptying my lungs
i reach out a hand trying to speak beg but that only seems to infuriate him further
hes kicking me faster and faster until theres nothing i can do but curl up in a ball as he pours his wrath upon me
i can barely breathe barely see
im sobbing buried beneath my pain
mercifully i pass out
10   day three  its dark the net on the window fluttering in the breath of a moonless night
the sheets are soft the bed comfortable and canopied
clutching the eiderdown i smile
it was a nightmare thats all
slowly beat by beat my heart quietens the taste of blood fading with the dream
it takes me a few seconds to remember where i am another to pick out the dim shape of a large man standing in the corner of the room
my breath catches in my throat
sliding my hand through the covers towards the bedside table i reach for the matches but they seem to slither away from my searching fingers
who are you i ask the darkness unable to keep the tremor from my voice
a friend  its a mans voice muffled and deep
friends dont lurk in the gloom i say
i didnt say i was your friend mr davies  my blind fumbling almost knocks the oil lamp off the bedside table
attempting to steady it my fingers find the matches cowering at its base
dont worry about the light says the darkness
it will little profit you  i strike the match with a trembling hand touching it to the lamp
flame explodes behind the glass driving the shadows deep into the corners and illuminating my visitor
its the man in the plague doctor costume i met earlier the light revealing details id missed in the gloom of the study
his greatcoat is scuffed and tattered at the edges a top hat and porcelain beak mask covering all of his face except for the eyes
gloved hands rest on a black cane an inscription inlaid in sparkling silver down the side though the writings much too small to read at this distance
observant good remarks the plague doctor
footsteps sound from somewhere in the house and i wonder if my imagination is sufficient to conjure the mundane details of such an extraordinary dream
what the hell are you doing in my room i demand surprising myself with this outburst
the beak mask ceases its exploration of the room fixing on me once again
we have work to do he says
i have a puzzle which requires a solution  i think youve mistaken me for somebody else i say angrily
im a doctor  you were a doctor he says
then a butler today a playboy tomorrow a banker
none of them is your real face or your real personality
those were stripped from you when you entered blackheath and they wont be returned until you leave  reaching into his pocket he pulls out a small mirror and tosses it onto the bed
see for yourself  the glass shakes in my hand reflecting a young man with striking blue eyes and precious little wisdom behind them
the face in the glass isnt that of sebastian bell or the burnt butler
his names donald davies says the plague doctor
he has a sister called grace and a best friend called jim and he doesnt like peanuts
davies will be your host for today and when you wake up tomorrow youll have another
thats how this works  it wasnt a dream after all it really happened
i lived the same day twice in the bodies of two different people
i talked to myself berated myself and examined myself through somebody elses eyes
im going mad arent i i say looking at him over the top of the mirror
i can hear the cracks in my voice
of course not says the plague doctor
madness would be an escape and theres only one way to escape blackheath
thats why im here i have a proposition for you  why have you done this to me i demand
thats a flattering notion but im not responsible for your predicament or blackheaths for that matter  then who is  nobody youd care to meet or need to he says dismissing the notion with a wave of his hand
which brings me back to my proposition  i must speak with them i say
speak with whom  the person who brought me here whoever can free me i say through gritted teeth struggling to keep hold of my temper
well the former is long gone and the latter is before you he says tapping his chest with both hands
perhaps its the costume but the movement seems somehow theatrical almost rehearsed
i suddenly have the sense of taking part in a play in which everybody knows their lines but me
only i know how you can escape blackheath he says
your proposition i say suspiciously
precisely though riddle might be closer to the truth of it he says lifting out a pocket watch and checking the time
somebodys going to be murdered at the ball tonight
it wont appear to be a murder and so the murderer wont be caught
rectify that injustice and ill show you the way out  i stiffen gripping the sheets
if freeing me is within your power why not just do it damn you i say
why play these games  because eternity is dull he says
or maybe because playing is the important part
ill leave you to speculate
just dont procrastinate for too long mr davies
this day will be repeated eight times and youll see it through the eyes of eight different hosts
bell was your first the butler your second and mr davies the third
that means you only have five hosts left to discover
if i were you i would move quickly
when you have an answer bring it to the lake along with proof at 11 pm ill be waiting for you  i will not play these games for your amusement i snarl leaning towards him
then fail out of spite but know this if you dont solve this problem by midnight in your final host well strip your memories and return you to the body of doctor bell and this will all begin again  he checks his watch dropping it into his pocket with an irritated tut
time runs away from us
cooperate and ill answer more of your questions next time we meet  a breeze slips through the window extinguishing the light and draping us in darkness
by the time i find the matches and relight it the plague doctor is gone
confused and afraid i jump out of bed as though stung throwing open the bedroom door and stepping into the cold
the corridors black
he could be standing five paces away and id never see him
closing the door i fly towards the wardrobe dressing myself in whatever comes to hand first
whoever im wearing hes skinny and short with a penchant for the garish and when im finished im splashed in purple trousers an orange shirt and a yellow waistcoat
theres a coat and scarf at the back of the cupboard and i pull them on before heading out
murder in the morning and costumes at night cryptic notes and burnt butlers whatevers happening here i will not be yanked around like some puppet on a string
i must escape this house
the grandfather clock at the top of the stairs points its weary arms at 317 am tutting at my haste
though im loathe to wake the stablemaster at such a frightful hour i can see no other choice if im to escape this madness so i take the staircase two steps at a time nearly tripping over this peacocks ridiculously tiny feet
it wasnt like this with bell or the butler
i feel myself pressed up against the walls of this body straining at its seams
im clumsy almost drunk
leaves scatter inside as i open the front door
its blowing a gale outside rain swirling in the air the forest cracking and swaying
its a filthy night the colour of tossed soot
ill need more light if im to find my way without falling and breaking my neck
retreating inside i head down the servants staircase at the rear of the entrance hall
the wood of the banister is rough to the touch the steps rickety
thankfully the lamps are still leaking their rancid light though the flames burn low and quiet their flicker indignant
the corridor is longer than i remember the whitewashed walls sweating with condensation the smell of earth spilling through the plaster
everythings damp rotten
ive seen most of blackheaths dirty edges but none so purposefully neglected
im surprised the place has any staff at all given how little regard they appear to be held in by their masters
in the kitchen i bounce between the stacked shelves until i find a hurricane lamp and matches
two strikes to light it and im bounding back up the stairs and through the front door into the storm
the lamp claws at the darkness the rain stinging my eyes
i follow the driveway to the cobbled road leading up to the stables the forest heaving around me
slipping over the uneven stones i strain my eyes for the stablemasters cottage but the lamps too bright concealing much of what it should reveal
im beneath the arch before i see it sliding on horse manure
as before the yard is a crush of carriages each covered in a rippling canvas sheet
unlike earlier the horses are in the stables snorting in their sleep
shaking the manure from my feet i throw myself on the mercy of the cottage banging the knocker
the light comes on after a few minutes the door opening a crack to reveal the sleepy face of an old man in his long johns
i need to leave i say
at this hour sir he asks dubiously rubbing his eyes and glancing at the pitchblack sky
youll catch your death  its urgent  he sighs taking in the scene then gestures me inside opening the door fully
putting on a pair of trousers he tugs the braces over his shoulders moving in that sluggish daze that marks someone roused unaccountably from their sleep
taking his jacket from the peg he drags himself outside motioning for me to stay where i am
i must confess i do so happily
the cottage bulges with warmth and homeliness the smell of leather and soap a solid comforting presence
im tempted to check the rota by the door to see if annas message is already written there but no sooner have i reached out my hand than i hear a godawful commotion lights blinding me through the window
stepping into the rain i find the old stablemaster sitting in a green automobile the entire thing coughing and shuddering as if afflicted by some terrible disease
here you go sir he says getting out
i got her started for you  but  im at a loss for words aghast at the contraption before me
are there no carriages i ask
there are but the horses are skittish around thunder sir he says reaching under his shirt to scratch an armpit
with respect you couldnt keep hold of them  i cant keep hold of this i say staring at the dreadful mechanical monster horror strangling my voice
rain is pinging off the metal and making a pond of the windscreen
easy as breathing it is he says
grip the wheel and point it where you want to go then press the pedal to the floor
youll make sense of it in no time  his confidence pushes me inside as firmly as any hand the door closing with a soft click
follow this cobbled road until the end and then turn left onto the dirt track he says pointing into the darkness
that will lead you to the village
its long and straight a bit uneven mind
takes anywhere between forty minutes and an hour depending on how carefully you drive but you cant miss it sir
if you wouldnt mind leave the automobile somewhere obvious and ill have one of my boys collect it first thing in the morning  with that hes gone disappearing back into his cottage the door slamming shut behind him
gripping the wheel i stare at the levers and dials trying to find some semblance of logic in the controls
i tentatively press the pedal the dreaded contraption lurches forward and applying a little more pressure i urge the automobile beneath the arch and along the bumpy cobbled road until we reach the left turn the stablemaster mentioned
rain blankets the glass forcing me to lean out of the window to see where im going
the headlamps shine on a dirt track littered with leaves and fallen branches water cascading across its surface
despite the danger i keep the accelerator pedal pinned to the floor elation replacing my unease
after everything thats happened im finally escaping blackheath each mile of this bumpy track taking me further from its madness
morning arrives in a smudge a grey halflight that taints rather than illuminates though it at least brings an end to the rain
as promised the road continues straight the forest unending
somewhere among those trees a girl is being murdered and bell is coming awake to see it
a killer will spare his life with a silver compass that points to a place that doesnt make sense and like a fool hell think himself saved
but how can i be in that forest and in this car – and a butler in between
my hands tighten around the wheel
if i was able to talk to the butler when i was sebastian bell then presumably whoever ill be tomorrow is already walking around blackheath
i might even have met him
and not just tomorrow but the man ill be the day after that and the day after that
if thats the case what does that make me
or them
are we shards of the same soul responsible for each others sins or entirely different people pale copies of some long forgotten original
the fuel gauge nudges red as fog comes rolling out of the trees thick upon the ground
my earlier sense of triumph has waned
i should have arrived at the village long ago but theres no chimney smoke in the distance and no end to the forest
finally the car shudders and stills its dying breath a screech of grinding parts as it comes to a stop mere feet from the plague doctor whose black greatcoat is in stark contrast to the white fog hes emerging from
my legs are stiff and my back sore but anger propels me out of the car
have you got this foolishness out of your system yet asks the plague doctor both hands resting on his cane
you could have done so much with this host instead you waste him on this road accomplishing nothing
blackheath wont let you go and while youre tugging on your lead your rivals are pressing ahead with their investigations  and now i have rivals i say contemptuously
its one trick after another with you isnt it
first you tell me im trapped here and now its a competition to escape  im marching towards him fully intending to beat an exit out of him
dont you understand yet i say
i dont care about your rules because im not going to play
either you let me leave or ill make you sorry i stayed  im two steps away when he points his cane at me
though it hovers an inch from my chest no cannon was ever so threatening
the silver lettering along the side is pulsing a faint shimmer rising from the wood burning away the fog
i can feel the heat of it through my clothes
if he desired im certain this benignlooking stick could rip a hole straight through me
donald davies is always the most childish of your hosts he tuts watching me take a nervous step backwards
but you dont have time to indulge him
there are two other people trapped in this house wearing the bodies of guests and servants just like you
only one of you can leave and it will be whoever brings me the answer first
now do you see
escape isnt to be found at the end of this dirt road its through me
so run if you must
run until you cant stand and when you wake up in blackheath again and again do so in the knowledge that nothing here is arbitrary nothing overlooked
youll stay here until i decide otherwise  lowering the cane he tugs loose his pocket watch
well speak again soon when youve calmed down a little he says putting the watch away again
try to use your hosts more wisely from now on
your rivals are more cunning than you can imagine and i guarantee they wont be so frivolous with their time  i want to charge him fists flying but now the red mist has passed i can see its a preposterous idea
even taking away the bulk of his costume hes a large man more than capable of weathering my assault
instead i veer around him the plague doctor heading back to blackheath as i press into the fog ahead
there may be no end to this road no village to be found but i cant give up until i know for sure
i wont return willingly to a madmans game
11   day four  i awake wheezing crushed beneath the tremendous monument of my new hosts stomach
the last thing i remember is collapsing exhausted on the road after walking for hours howling in desperation at a village i couldnt reach
the plague doctor was telling the truth
theres no escape from blackheath
a carriage clock by the bed tells me its 1030 am and im about to rise when a tall man enters through a connecting room carrying a silver tray which he lays on the sideboard
hes in his midthirties id guess darkhaired and cleanshaven blandly attractive without being memorable in any way
a pair of glasses have slipped down his small nose his eyes fixed on the curtains hes walking towards
without saying a word he draws them and pushes open the windows revealing views of the garden and forest
i watch him in fascination
theres something oddly precise about this man
his actions are small and quick without any wasted effort
its as though hes saving his energy for some great labour ahead
for a minute or so he stands at the window with his back to me letting the room breathe cold air
i feel as though something is expected of me that this pause has been manufactured for my benefit but for the life of me i cant guess what i should be doing
no doubt sensing my indecision he abandons his vigil slipping his hands under my armpits and tugging me into a sitting position
i pay for his assistance in shame
my silk pyjamas are soaked through with sweat and the odour rising from my body is so pungent it brings tears to my eyes
oblivious to my embarrassment my companion retrieves the silver tray from the sideboard and places it on my lap lifting the dome cover
the platter beneath is piled high with eggs and bacon a side helping of pork chops a pot of tea and a jug of milk
such a meal should be daunting but im ravenous and tear into it like an animal while the tall man – who i can only assume is my valet – disappears behind an oriental screen the sound of pouring water issuing forth
pausing for breath i take this opportunity to examine my surroundings
in contrast to the frugal comforts of bells bedroom this place is awash in wealth
red velvet drapes flow down the windows piling up on a thick blue carpet
art spots the walls the lacquered mahogany furniture polished to a shine
whoever i am hes held in high esteem by the hardcastle family
the valet returns to find me mopping grease from my lips with a napkin panting with the effort of eating
he must be disgusted
i am disgusted
i feel like a pig in a trough
even so no flicker of emotion shows on his face as he removes the tray and slides my arm across his shoulders to better help me out of bed
god only knows how many times hes been through this ritual or what hes paid to do it but once is enough for me
like a wounded soldier he halfwalks halfdrags me behind the screen where a steaming hot bath has been prepared
thats when he begins to undress me
i have no doubt this is all part of the routine but the shames too much to bear
though this isnt my body im humiliated by it appalled by the waves of flesh lapping against my hips the way my legs rub together as i walk
i shoo my companion away but its pointless
my lord you cant he pauses collecting his words together carefully youre not going to be able to get in and out of the bath alone  i want to tell him to go hang to leave me in peace but he is of course correct
squeezing my eyes shut i nod my submission
in practised motions he unbuttons my pyjama top and pulls down the bottoms lifting my feet one at a time so i dont become tangled in them
in a few seconds im naked my companion standing at a respectful distance
opening my eyes i find myself reflected in a fulllength mirror on the wall
i resemble some grotesque caricature of the human body my skin jaundiced and swollen a flaccid penis peeking out of an unkempt crop of pubic hair
overcome by disgust and humiliation i let out a sob
surprise lights up the valets face and then just for a moment delight
its a patch of raw emotion gone as quickly as it appeared
hurrying over he helps me into the bathtub
i remember the euphoria i felt climbing into the hot water as bell but theres none of that now
my immense weight means the joy of getting into a warm bath is eclipsed by the certain humiliation of getting out of it again
will you require the reports this morning lord ravencourt asks my companion
sitting stiff in the bath i shake my head hoping hell leave the room
the house has prepared a few activities for the day hunting a forest walk they asked –  i shake my head again staring at the water
how much more must i endure
very well then its just the appointments  cancel them i say quietly
cancel them all  even with lady hardcastle my lord  i find his green eyes for the first time
the plague doctor claimed i must solve a murder to depart this house and who better than the lady of the house to help me sift through its secrets
no not that one i say
remind me where were meeting again  in your parlour my lord
unless you wanted me to change it  no that will suffice  very well my lord  the last of our business concluded he departs with a nod leaving me to wallow in peace alone with my misery
closing my eyes i rest my head on the edge of the bath trying to make sense of my situation
finding their soul cut loose from their body would suggest death to some but deep down i know this isnt the afterlife
hell would have fewer servants and better furnishings and stripping a man of his sins seems a poor way to sit in judgement on him
no im alive though not in any state i recognise
this is something next to death something more devious and im not alone
the plague doctor claimed there are three of us competing to escape blackheath
could the footman who left me the dead rabbit be trapped as i am
that would explain why hes trying to scare me
after all a race is hard to win if youre afraid of reaching the finishing line
perhaps this is what the plague doctor considers entertainment setting us against each other like halfstarved dogs in a pit
maybe you should trust him
so much for trauma i mutter at the voice
i thought id left you in bell  i know its a lie even as i say it
im connected to this voice in the same way im connected to the plague doctor and the footman
i can feel the weight of our history even if i cant remember it
theyre part of everything thats happening to me pieces of this puzzle im scrambling to solve
whether theyre friends or enemies i cant be certain but whatever the voices true nature it hasnt led me astray so far
even so trusting my captor strikes me as naivety at best
the idea that all of this will end should i solve a murder seems preposterous
whatever the plague doctors intent he came concealed by mask and midnight
hes wary of being seen which means theres leverage to be found in ripping that mask free
i glance at the clock weighing my options
i know hell be in the study talking with sebastian bell – a previous me i still cant quite wrap my head around it
– after the hunt departs which would seem an ideal time to intercept him
if he wishes me to solve a murder ill do so but it wont be my only task today
if im to ensure my freedom i must know the identity of the man who has taken it from me and for that im going to need some help
by the plague doctors count ive already wasted three of my eight days in this house those belonging to sebastian bell the butler and donald davies
including myself that means i have five remaining hosts and if bells encounter with the butler is any guide theyre walking around blackheath as i am
thats an army in waiting
i just need to work out who theyre wearing
12   the waters long cold leaving me blue and shivering
vainglorious though it may be i cant bear the thought of ravencourts valet lifting me out of this bath like a sodden sack of potatoes
a polite knock on the bedroom door relieves me of the decision
lord ravencourt is all well he calls entering the room
quite well i insist my hands numb
his head appears around the edge of the screen his eyes taking hold of the scene
after a moments scrutiny he approaches without my beckoning rolling up his sleeves to pull me out of the water with a strength that belies his thin frame
this time i do not protest
i have too little pride left to salvage
as he helps me out of the bathtub i spot the edge of a tattoo poking from beneath his shirt
its smeared green the details lost
noticing my attention he hurriedly pulls his sleeve down
folly of youth my lord he says
for ten minutes i stand there quietly humiliated as he towels me dry mothering me into my suit one leg then the next one arm then the other
the clothes are silk beautifully tailored but tugging and pinching like a roomful of elderly aunts
theyre a size too small fitting ravencourts vanity rather than his body
when all is done the valet combs my hair rubbing coconut oil into my fleshy face before handing me a mirror that i might better inspect the results
the reflection is nearing sixty with suspiciously black hair and brown eyes the colour of weak tea
i search them for some sign of myself the hidden man working ravencourts strings but im obscured
for the first time i wonder who i was before coming here and the chain of events that led me into this trap
such speculation would be intriguing if it werent so frustrating
as with bell my skin prickles when i see ravencourt in the mirror
some part of me remembers my real face and is perplexed by this stranger staring back
i hand the mirror to the valet
we need to go to the library i say
i know where it is my lord he says
shall i fetch you a book  im coming with you  the valet pauses frowning
he speaks hesitatingly his words testing the ground theyre tiptoeing across
its a fair walk my lord
i fear you may find it tiring  ill manage besides i need the exercise  arguments queue behind his teeth but he fetches my cane and an attaché case and leads me into a dark corridor oil lamps spilling their warm light across the walls
we walk slowly the valet tossing news at my feet but my mind is fixed on the ponderousness of this body im dragging forward
its as though some fiend has remade the house overnight stretching the rooms and thickening the air
wading into the sudden brightness of the entrance hall im surprised to discover how steep the staircase now appears
the steps i sprinted down as donald davies would require climbing equipment to surmount this morning
little wonder lord and lady hardcastle lodged ravencourt on the ground floor
it would take a pulley two strong men and a days pay to hoist me into bells room
requiring frequent rests at least allows me to observe my fellow guests as they make their way around the house and its immediately evident that this is not a happy gathering
whispered arguments spill out of nooks and crannies raised voices moving hurriedly up the stairs only to be cut off by slamming doors
husbands and wives goad each other drinks gripped too tightly faces flushed red with barely controlled rage
theres a needle in every exchange the air prickly and dangerous
perhaps its nerves or the hollow wisdom of foresight but blackheath seems fertile ground for tragedy
my legs are trembling by the time we arrive at the library my back aching with the effort of holding myself erect
unfortunately the room offers scant reward for such suffering
dusty overburdened bookshelves line the walls a mouldy red carpet smothering the floor
the bones of an old fire lie in the grate opposite a small reading table with an uncomfortable wooden chair placed beside it
my companion sums up his feelings in a single tut
one moment my lord ill fetch you a more comfortable chair from the drawing room he says
ill need it
my left palm is blistered where its rubbed against the top of the cane and my legs are wobbling beneath me
sweat has soaked through my shirt leaving my entire body itchy
crossing the house has left me a wreck and if im to reach the lake tonight before my rivals im going to need a new host preferably one capable of conquering a staircase
ravencourts valet returns with a wingback chair placing it on the floor in front of me
taking my arm he lowers me into the green cushions
may i ask our purpose here my lord  if were very lucky were meeting friends i reply mopping my face with a handkerchief
do you have a piece of paper to hand  of course  he retrieves some foolscap and a fountain pen from his attaché case standing ready to take dictation
i open my mouth to dismiss him but one look at my sweaty blistered hand dissuades me
in this instance pride is a poor cousin to legibility
after taking a minute to arrange the words in my head i begin speaking aloud
its logical to believe that many of you have been here longer than i and possess knowledge of this house our purpose here and our captor the plague doctor that i do not  i pause listening to the scratching of the pen
you have not sought me out and i must assume theres a good reason for that but i ask you now to meet me in the library at lunchtime and help me apprehend our captor
if you cannot i ask you to share what youve learned by writing it on this paper
whatever you know no matter how trivial may be of use in helping speed our escape
they say two heads are better than one but i believe in this case our combined head may be sufficient  i wait for the scribbling to end then look up at my companions face
its mystified though also a touch amused
hes a curious fellow this one not at all the straight edge he first appears
should i post this my lord he asks
no need i say pointing towards the bookshelf
slide it within the pages of the first volume of the encyclopaedia britannica theyll know where to find it  he eyes me then the note before doing as i ask the page slipping neatly inside
it seems a fitting home
and when should we expect a response my lord  minutes hours i cant be certain
well have to keep checking back  and until then he asks wiping the dust from his hands with a pocket square
talk to the servants i need to know if any of the guests has a medieval plague doctor costume in their wardrobe  my lord  porcelain mask black greatcoat that sort of thing i say
in the meantime im going to have a nap  here my lord  indeed  he watches me with a frown trying to stitch together the scraps of information scattered before him
should i light a fire he asks
no need ill be quite comfortable i say
very well he says hovering
im not sure what hes waiting for but it never arrives and with a final look he leaves the room his confusion creeping out quietly behind him
placing my hands on my stomach i close my eyes
every time ive slept ive woken up in a different body and while its risky sacrificing a host this way i cant see what more i can accomplish in ravencourt
with any luck when i awaken my other selves will have made contact through the encyclopaedia and ill be among them
13   day two continued  agony
i scream tasting blood
i know i know im sorry says a womans voice
a pinch a needle enters my neck
warmth melts the pain
its hard to breathe impossible to move
i cant open my eyes
i hear rolling wheels hooves on cobbles a presence by my side
i i start coughing
shush dont try and talk
youre back in the butler says the woman in an urgent whisper laying a hand on my arm
its been fifteen minutes since gold attacked you and youre being taken by carriage to the gatehouse to rest  who are i croak
a friend it doesnt matter yet
now listen i know youre confused tired but this is important
there are rules to all of this
theres no use trying to abandon your hosts the way you did
you get a full day in each of them whether you want it or not
thats from whenever they wake up until midnight
understand  im dozing struggling to stay awake
thats why youre back here she continues
if one of your hosts falls asleep before midnight youll jump back into the butler and carry on living this day
when the butler falls asleep youll be returned
if the host slept past midnight or if they died youll jump into somebody new  i hear another voice
rougher
from the front of the carriage
gatehouse coming up  her hand touches my forehead
good luck to you  too tired to hold on i slip back into the dark
14   day four continued  a hand rocks my shoulder
blinking my eyes open i find myself back in the library back in ravencourt
relief washes over me
id thought nothing could be worse than this bulk but i was wrong
the butlers body felt like a bag of broken glass and id live a lifetime as ravencourt before id go back to that torment though it doesnt appear i have a choice
if the woman in the carriage is telling the truth im destined to be pulled back there again
daniel coleridge is looking down at me through a cloud of yellow smoke
a cigarette dangles from his lip a drink in his hand
hes wearing the same scuffed hunting clothes as when he talked with sebastian bell in the study
my eyes flick to the clock its twenty minutes before lunchtime
he must be on his way to that meeting now
he hands me the drink and sits down on the edge of the table opposite the encyclopaedia now lying open beside him
i believe you were looking for me says daniel blowing smoke from the corner of his mouth
he sounds different through ravencourts ears the softness shed like an old skin
before i can answer him he begins reading from the encyclopaedia
its logical to believe that many of you have been here longer than i and possess knowledge of this house our purpose here and our captor the plague doctor that i do not he closes the book
you called and i answered  i search the shrewd eyes fixed upon me
youre like me i say
i am you just four days ahead he says pausing to let my mind ram itself against the idea
daniel coleridge is your final host
our soul his body if you can make any sense of that
unfortunately its his mind too – he taps his forehead with his forefinger – which means you and i think differently  he holds up the encyclopaedia
take this for example he says letting it drop on the table
coleridge would never have thought to write to our other hosts asking for help
it was a clever idea very logical very ravencourt  his cigarette flares in the gloom illuminating the hollow smile beneath
this is not the daniel of yesterday
theres something colder harder in his gaze something trying to pry me open so it might peer inside
i dont know how i didnt see it when i was bell
ted stanwin did when he backed down in the drawing room
the thugs cleverer than i gave him credit for
so youve already been me this me ravencourt i mean i say
and those who follow him he says
theyre a difficult bunch you should enjoy ravencourt while you can  is that why youre here to warn me about my other hosts  the notion seems to amuse him a smile touching his lips before drifting away with the cigarette smoke
no ive come because i remember sitting where you are and being told what im about to tell you  which is  theres an ashtray on the far side of the table and he reaches across drawing it towards him
the plague doctor has asked you to solve a murder but he didnt mention the victim
its evelyn hardcastle thats whos going to die at the ball tonight he says tapping ash into the ashtray
evelyn i say struggling to sit upright splashing a little of my forgotten drink across my leg
panic has hold of me a terror of my friend being hurt a woman who went out of her way to be kind to me even as her own parents filled the house with cruelty
we must warn her i demand
to what end asks daniel dousing my alarm with his calm
we cannot solve the murder of somebody who isnt dead and without that answer we cannot escape  you would let her die i say shocked by his callousness
ive lived this day eight times over and shes died every evening regardless of my actions he says running his finger along the edge of the table
whatever happened yesterday it will happen tomorrow and the day after
i promise you however you may consider interfering youve already tried and its already failed  shes my friend daniel i say surprised at the depth of my feeling
and mine he says leaning closer
but every time ive tried to change todays events ive ended up becoming the architect of whatever misery i was trying to prevent
believe me trying to save evelyn is a waste of time
circumstances beyond my control brought me here and very soon sooner than you can imagine youll find yourself sitting where i am explaining it as i have and wishing you still had the luxury of ravencourts hope
the future isnt a warning my friend its a promise and it wont be broken by us
thats the nature of the trap were caught in  rising from the table he wrestles with a windows rusty handle and pushes it open
his eyes are fixed on some distant point a task four days beyond my comprehension
he has no interest in me my fears or hopes
im just part of some old story hes tired of telling
it makes no sense i say hoping to remind him of evelyns qualities the reasons shes worth saving
evelyns kind and gentle and shes been away for nineteen years whod want to harm her now  even as i say it a suspicion begins to dawn on me
in the forest yesterday evelyn mentioned that her parents had never forgiven her for letting thomas wander off alone
she blamed herself for his murder at carvers hands and worst of all so did they
their ire was so great she believed they were plotting some terrible surprise at the ball
could this be it
could they really hate their own daughter enough to murder her
if so my meeting with helena hardcastle could prove fortuitous indeed
i dont know says daniel a note of irritation in his voice
there are so many secrets in this house it can be difficult to pick the right one from the pile
if you heed my advice though youll start looking for anna immediately
eight hosts may sound a great deal but this task needs double that number
youre going to need all the help you can get  anna i exclaim remembering the woman in the carriage with the butler
i thought she was an acquaintance of bells  he takes a long drag on his cigarette considering me through narrowed eyes
i can see him sifting through the future working out how much to tell me
shes trapped here like us he says eventually
shes a friend as much as somebody can be in our situation
you should find her quickly before the footman does
hes hunting us both  he left a dead rabbit in my room – bells room i mean – last night  thats only the beginning he says
he means to kill us though not before hes had his fun  my blood runs cold my stomach nauseous
id suspected as much but to hear the fact laid out so baldly is something else entirely
closing my eyes i let a long breath out through my nose releasing my fear with it
its a habit of ravencourts a way of clearing the mind though i couldnt say how i know that
when i open my eyes again im calm
who is he i ask impressed by the strength in my voice
ive no idea he says blowing smoke into the wind
id call him the devil if i thought this place anything so mundane as hell
hes picking us off one by one making sure theres no competition when he delivers his answer to the plague doctor tonight  does he have other bodies other hosts like us  thats the curious thing he says
i dont believe he does but he doesnt seem to need them
he knows the faces of every one of our hosts and he strikes when were at our weakest
every mistake ive made hes been waiting  how do we stop a man who knows our every step before we do  if i knew that thered be no need of this conversation he says irritably
be careful
he haunts this house like a bloody ghost and if he catches you alone well dont let him catch you alone  daniels tone is dark his expression brooding
whoever this footman is he has taken hold of my future self in a way thats more unsettling than all the warnings ive heard
its not hard to understand why
the plague doctor gave me eight days to solve evelyns murder and eight hosts to do it
because sebastian bell slept past midnight hes now lost to me
that leaves seven days and seven hosts
my second and third hosts were the butler and donald davies
the woman in the carriage didnt mention davies which seems a curious omission but im assuming the same rules apply to him as the butler
they both have plenty of hours left until midnight but one of them is severely injured and the other asleep on a road miles from blackheath
theyre practically useless
so much for days two and three
im already on my fourth day and ravencourt is proving a burden rather than a boon
i dont know what to expect from my remaining four hosts – though daniel seems capable enough – but it feels as though the plague doctor is stacking the deck against me
if the footman truly knows my every weakness then god help me because there are plenty to exploit
tell me everything youve already learned about evelyns death i say
if we work together we can solve it before the footman has a chance to harm us  the only thing i can tell you is that she dies promptly at 11 pm every single night  surely you must know more than that  a great deal more but i cant risk sharing the information he says glancing at me
all my plans are built around things youre going to do
if i tell you something that stops you doing those things i cant be certain theyll play out the same way
you might blunder into the middle of an event settled in my favour or be elsewhere when you should have been distracting the fellow whose room im sneaking into
one wrong word could leave all my plans in ruins
this day must proceed as it always does for your sake as much as mine he rubs his forehead all of his weariness seeming to pour out of the gesture
im sorry ravencourt the safest course is for you to go about your investigation without interference from me or any of the others  very well i say hoping to keep my disappointment from him
its a foolish notion of course
hes me
he remembers this disappointment for himself
but the fact youre counselling me to solve this murder suggests you trust the plague doctor i say
have you uncovered his identity  not yet he says
and trust is too strong a word
he has his own purpose in this house im certain of it but for the moment i cant see any other course beyond doing as he demands  and has he told you why this is happening to us i ask
were interrupted by a commotion at the door our heads turning towards ravencourts valet whos halfway out of his coat and trying to extricate himself from the clutches of a long purple scarf
hes windtussled and slightly out of breath his cheeks swollen with cold
i received a message that you required me urgently my lord he says still tugging at the scarf
my doing old love says daniel deftly slipping back into character
youve a busy day ahead and i thought cunningham here could be of use
speaking of busy days i must be going myself
ive got a midday appointment with sebastian bell  i wont leave evelyn to her fate daniel i say
neither did i he says flicking his cigarette into the verge and shutting the window
but fate found her anyway
you should prepare yourself for that  hes gone in a few long strides the library filling with the burble of voices and the loud clatter of cutlery as he tugs open the door into the study and passes through on his way to the drawing room
the guests are gathering for lunch which means stanwin will soon threaten the maid lucy harper while sebastian bell watches from the window feeling himself a fraction of a man
a hunt will depart evelyn will collect a note from the well and blood will be spilt in a graveyard while two friends wait for a woman wholl never arrive
if daniels right theres little i can do to disrupt the days course though ill be damned if im going to lie down before it
the plague doctors puzzle may be my way out of this house but ill not step over evelyns body to escape
i mean to save her no matter the cost
how can i be of service my lord  pass me paper a pen and some ink would you
i need to write something down  of course he says retrieving the items from his attaché case
my hands are too clumsy for flowing penmanship but amidst the smeared ink and ugly blots the message reads clearly enough
i check the clock
its 1156 am
almost time
after airing the paper to dry the ink i fold it neatly and press the creases down handing it to cunningham
take this i say noticing the traces of greasy black dirt on his hands as he reaches for the letter
his skins pink with scrubbing but the dirts etched into the whorls of his fingertips
aware of my attention he takes the letter and clasps his hands behind his back
i need you to go directly to the drawing room where theyre serving lunch i say
stay there and observe events as they unfold then read this letter and return to me  confusion paints his face
my lord  were about to have a very strange day cunningham and im going to need your absolute trust  i wave away his protests gesturing for him to help me out of the seat
do as i ask i say getting to my feet with a grunt
then return here and wait for me  as cunningham heads for the drawing room i retrieve my cane and make my way to the sun room in the hopes of finding evelyn
being early its only half full ladies pouring themselves drinks from the bar wilting over chairs and chaise longues
everything seems to be a very great effort for them as though the pale flush of youth were a burden their energy exhausting
theyre muttering about evelyn a ripple of ugly laughter directed towards the chess table in the corner where a game is laid out before her
she has no opponent her concentration fixed on outwitting herself
whatever discomfort theyre hoping to heap upon her she seems oblivious to it
evie can we speak i say hobbling over
she lifts her head slowly taking a moment to register me
as yesterday her blonde hair is tied up into a ponytail tugging her features into a gaunt rather severe expression
unlike yesterday it doesnt soften
no i dont think so lord ravencourt she says returning her attention to the board
ive quite enough unpleasant things to do today without adding to the list  hushed laughter turns my blood to dust
i crumble from the inside out
please evie its  its miss hardcastle lord ravencourt she says pointedly
manners maketh man not his bank account  a pit of humiliation opens in my stomach
this is ravencourts worst nightmare
standing in this room a dozen pairs of eyes upon me i feel like a christian waiting for the first rocks to be thrown
evelyn ponders me sweating and shaking
her eyes narrow glittering
tell you what play me for it she says tapping the chessboard
you win and well have a conversation i win and you leave me be for the rest of the day
how would that suit  knowing its a trap but in no position to argue i wipe the sweat from my brow and wedge myself into the small chair opposite her much to the delight of the assembled ladies
she could have forced me into a guillotine and i would have been more comfortable
i spill over the sides of the seat the low back offering so little support that i tremble with the effort of keeping myself upright
unmoved by my suffering evelyn crosses her arms on the table and pushes a pawn across the board
i follow it with a rook the pattern of the middle game weaving itself in my mind
although were evenly matched discomfort is digging holes in my concentration my tactics proving too ramshackle to overpower evelyn
the best i can do is prolong the match and after half an hour of counters and feints my patience is exhausted
your life is in danger i blurt out
evelyns fingers pause on her pawn a little tremor of her hand sounding loud as a bell
her eyes skirt my face then those of the ladies behind us searching for anybody who might have heard
theyre frantic working hard to scrub the moment from history
she already knows
i thought we had a deal lord ravencourt she interrupts her expression hardening once more
but  would you prefer i leave she says her glare strangling any further attempts at conversation
move after move follows but im so perplexed by her response i pay little heed to strategy
whatevers going to happen tonight evelyn seems to be aware of it and yet her greater fear seems to be that somebody else will find out
for the life of me i cant imagine why that would be and its clear shes not going to open her heart to ravencourt
her disdain for this man is absolute which means if im to save her life i must either put on a face she likes or press forward without her help
its an infuriating turn of events and im desperately trying to find a way of reframing my argument when sebastian bell arrives at the door provoking the queerest of sensations
by any measure this man is me but watching him creep into the room like a mouse along a skirting board i struggle to believe it
his back is stooped his head low arms stiff by his sides
furtive glances scout every step his world seemingly filled with sharp edges
my grandmother heather hardcastle says evelyn watching him examine the portrait on the wall
its not a flattering picture but then she wasnt a flattering woman by all accounts  my apologies says bell
i was  their conversation proceeds exactly as it did yesterday her interest in this frail creature prompting a pang of jealousy though thats not my principal concern
bells repeating my day exactly and yet he believes himself to be making his choices freely as i did
likely then im blindly following a course plotted by daniel which makes me what an echo a memory or just a piece of driftwood caught in the current
flip over the chessboard change this moment
prove yourself unique
my hand reaches out but the thought of evelyns reaction her disdain the laughter of the assembled ladies is too much
shame cripples me and i jerk my hand back
therell be further opportunities i need to keep watch for them
thoroughly demoralised and with defeat unavoidable i dash the last few moves putting my king to the sword with unseemly haste before staggering from the room sebastian bells voice fading behind me
15   as ordered cunninghams waiting for me in the library
hes sitting on the edge of a chair the letter i gave him unfolded and trembling slightly in his hand
he stands as i enter but in my desire to put the sun room behind me ive moved too quickly
i can hear myself breathing wheezy desperate bursts from my overburdened lungs
he doesnt venture to help
how did you know what was going to happen in the drawing room he asks
i try to answer but there isnt room for both words and air in my throat
i choose the latter guzzling it with the same appetite as everything else in ravencourts life while staring into the study
id hoped to catch the plague doctor while he chatted with bell but my futile attempt to warn evelyn dragged on longer than i expected
perhaps i shouldnt be surprised
as i saw on the road to the village the plague doctor seems to know where ill be and when no doubt timing his appearances so i cant ambush him
it happened exactly as you described it continues cunningham staring at the paper in disbelief
ted stanwin insulted the maid and daniel coleridge stepped in
they even spoke the words you wrote down
they spoke them exactly  i could explain but he hasnt got to the section troubling him yet
instead i hobble over to the chair lowering myself onto the cushion with a great deal of effort
my legs throb in pitiful gratitude
was it a trick he asks
no trick i say
and this the final line where you say  yes   that youre not lord ravencourt  im not ravencourt i say
youre not  im not
get a drink youre looking a little pale  he does as i say obedience seemingly being the only part of him that hasnt thrown its hands up in defeat
he returns with a glass of something and sits down sipping it his eyes never leaving mine legs pressed together shoulders bowed
i tell him everything from the murder in the forest and my first day as bell right through to the neverending road and my recent conversation with daniel
doubt flickers on his face but every time it seems to have a foothold he glances at the letter
i almost feel sorry for him
do you need another drink i ask nodding towards his halfempty glass
if youre not lord ravencourt where is he  i dont know  is he alive  he can barely make eye contact
would you rather he wasnt i ask
lord ravencourts been good to me he says anger flashing across his face
that doesnt answer the question
i look at cunningham again
downcast eyes and dirty hands a smeared tattoo from a troubled past
in a flash of intuition i realise hes afraid but not of what ive told him
hes afraid of what somebody whos already seen this day unfold might know
hes hiding something im certain of it
i need your help cunningham i say
theres lots to do and while im shackled to ravencourt i dont have the legs to do any of it  draining his glass he gets to his feet
the drinks painted two spots of colour on his cheeks and when he speaks his voice drips with the bottles courage
im going to take my leave now and resume service tomorrow when lord ravencourt has – he pauses considering the right word – returned  he bows stiffly before heading for the door
do you think hell take you back when he knows your secret i say abruptly an idea dropping into my head like a stone into a pond
if im right and cunningham is hiding something it may be shameful enough to use as leverage
he stops dead beside my chair hands clenched tight
what do you mean he says staring straight ahead
look beneath the cushion of your seat i say trying to keep the tension from my voice
the logic of what im attempting is sound but that doesnt mean it will actually work
he glances at the chair then back towards me
without a word he does as i say discovering a small white envelope
triumph twists a smile from my lips as he tears it open his shoulders sagging
how did you know he asks his voice cracked
i dont know a thing but when i wake up in my next host im going to dedicate myself to the task of uncovering your secret
im then going to return to this room and place the information in that envelope for you to find
should this conversation not go the way i want ill place the envelope where the other guests can find it  he snorts at me his contempt a slap in the face
you may not be ravencourt but you sound exactly like him  the idea is so startling it momentarily silences me
until now id assumed my personality – whatever that might be – was carried into each new host filling them as pennies fill a pocket but what if i was wrong
none of my previous hosts would have thought to blackmail cunningham let alone had the stomach to act on the threat
in fact looking back at sebastian bell roger collins donald davies and now ravencourt i can see little in their behaviour to suggest a common hand at work
could it be that im bending to their will rather than the other way around
if so i must be wary
its one thing to be caged in these people quite another to abandon oneself entirely to their desires
my thoughts are interrupted by cunningham whos setting fire to a corner of the letter with a lighter from his pocket
what is it you want from me he says in a hard flat voice dropping the burning paper into the grate
four things initially i say counting them off on my thick fingers
first i need you to find an old well off the road into the village
therell be a note tucked into a crack in the stone
read it put it back and return to me with the message
do it soon the note will be gone within the hour
secondly you need to find that plague doctor costume i asked about earlier
thirdly i want you scattering the name anna around blackheath like confetti
let it be known lord ravencourt is looking for her
finally i need you to introduce yourself to sebastian bell  sebastian bell the doctor  thats the chap  why  because i remember being sebastian bell but i dont remember meeting you i say
if we change that it means i prove to myself that something else can be changed today  evelyn hardcastles death  precisely  letting out a long breath cunningham turns to face me
he seems diminished as though our conversation were a desert hes spent a week crossing
if i do these things can i expect the contents of this letter to stay between us he says his expression conveying more hope than expectation
it will you have my word  i extend a sweaty hand
then it seems i have no choice he says shaking it firmly only the slightest flicker of disgust showing on his face
he departs in a hurry probably wary of being burdened with more tasks should he linger
in his absence the damp air seems to settle upon me sinking through my clothes and into my bones
judging the library too cheerless to stay in any longer i struggle out of my seat using my cane to hoist myself onto my feet
i pass through the study on my way to ravencourts parlour where ill settle myself ahead of my meeting with helena hardcastle
if shes plotting to murder evelyn this evening then by lord i mean to have it out of her
the house is still the men out hunting and the women drinking in the sun room
even the servants have disappeared scattering back below stairs to prepare for the ball
in their wake a great hush has fallen my only company the rain tapping at the windows demanding to be let inside
bell missed the noise but as somebody finely tuned to the malice of others ravencourt finds this silence refreshing
its like airing a musty room
heavy steps disturb my reverie each one deliberate and slow as if determined to draw my attention
ive reached as far as the dining hall where a long oak table is overlooked by the mounted heads of longslaughtered beasts their fur faded and thick with dust
the room is empty and yet the steps seem to be all around mimicking my hobbling gait
i stiffen coming to a halt sweat beading my brow
the steps stop in turn
dabbing my forehead i look around nervously wishing bells paperknife were to hand
buried in ravencourts sluggish flesh i feel like a man dragging an anchor
i can neither run nor fight and even if i could id be swinging at air
im quite alone
after a brief hesitation i begin walking again those ghostly steps trailing me
i stop suddenly and they stop with me a sinister giggle drifting out of the walls
my hearts pounding hair standing up on my arms as fright sends me lurching towards the safety of the entrance hall visible through the drawingroom door
by now the steps arent bothering mimicking me theyre dancing that giggle seeming to come from every direction
im panting by the time i reach the doorway blinded by sweat and moving so fast im in danger of tripping over my own cane
as i pass into the entrance hall the laughter stops abruptly a whisper chasing me out
well meet soon little rabbit      16   ten minutes later the whispers long faded but the terror it provoked echoes still
it wasnt the words themselves so much as the glee they carried
that warning was a down payment on the blood and pain to come and only a fool wouldnt see the footman behind it
holding my hand up i check to see how badly its trembling and deciding that im at least moderately recovered i continue onwards to my room
ive only taken a step or two when sobbing draws my attention to a dark doorway at the back of the entrance hall
for a full minute i hover on the periphery peering into the dimness fearing a trap
surely the footman wouldnt try something so soon or be able to summon up these pitiable gulps of sadness im hearing now
sympathy compels me to take a tentative step forward and i find myself in a narrow gallery adorned with hardcastle family portraits
generations wither on the walls the current incumbents of blackheath hanging nearest the door
lady helena hardcastle is sitting regally beside her standing husband both of them darkhaired and darkeyed beautifully supercilious
next to them are the portraits of the children evelyn at a window fingering the edge of the curtain as she watches for somebodys arrival while michael has one leg flung over the arm of the chair hes sitting in a book discarded on the floor
he looks bored shimmering with a restless energy
in the corner of each portrait is a splashed signature that of gregory gold if im not very much mistaken
the memory of the butlers beating at the artists hands is still fresh and i find myself gripping my cane tasting the blood in my mouth once again
evelyn told me gold had been brought to blackheath to touch up the portraits and i can see why
the man may be insane but hes talented
another sob issues from the corner of the room
there are no windows in the gallery only burning oil lamps and its so dim i have to squint to locate the maid slumped in the shadows weeping into a soggy handkerchief
tact would advise that i approach quietly but ravencourts ill designed for stealth
my cane raps the floor the sound of my breathing running on ahead announcing my presence
catching sight of me the maid leaps to her feet her cap coming loose curly red hair springing free
i recognise her immediately
this is lucy harper the maid ted stanwin abused at lunch and the woman who helped me down to the kitchen when i awoke as the butler
the memory of that kindness echoes within me a warm rush of pity shaping the words in my mouth
im sorry lucy i didnt mean to startle you i say
no sir its not
i shouldnt she casts around for some escape miring herself further in etiquette
i heard you crying i say attempting to push a sympathetic smile onto my face
its a difficult thing to achieve with somebody elses mouth especially when theres so much flesh to move around
oh sir you shouldnt it was my fault
i made a mistake at lunch she says dabbing the last of her tears away
ted stanwin treated you atrociously i say surprised by the alarm rising on her face
no sir you mustnt say that she says her voice hurdling an entire octave
ted mr stanwin i mean hes been good to us servants
always treated us right he has
hes just now hes a gentleman he cant be seen  shes on the verge of tears again
i understand i say hastily
he doesnt want the other guests treating him like a servant  a smile swallows her face
thats it sir thats just it
theyd never have caught charlie carver if it werent for ted but the other gentlemen still look at him like hes one of us
not lord hardcastle though he calls him mr stanwin and everything  well as long as youre quite all right i say taken aback by the pride in her voice
i am sir really i am she says earnestly emboldened enough to scoop her cap from the floor
i should be getting back theyll be wondering where ive got to  she takes a step towards the door but is too slow to prevent me throwing a question in her path
lucy do you know anybody called anna i ask
i was thinking she could be a servant  anna she pauses tossing the full weight of her thought at the problem
no sir cant say as i do  any of the maids acting strangely  now sir would you believe youre the third person to ask that question today she says twisting a lock of her curly hair around her finger
third  yes sir mrs derby was down in the kitchen only an hour ago wondering the same thing
gave us a right fright she did
highborn lady like that wandering around downstairs aint ever heard of such a thing  my hand grips my cane
whoever this mrs derby is shes acting oddly and asking the same questions i am
perhaps ive found another of my rivals
or another host
the suggestion makes me blush ravencourts familiarity with women extending only so far as acknowledging their existence in the world
the thought of becoming one is as unintelligible to him as a day spent breathing water
what can you tell me about mrs derby i ask
nothing much sir says lucy
older lady sharp tongue
i liked her
not sure if it means anything but there was a footman as well
came in a few minutes after mrs derby asking the same question any of the servants acting funny  my hand squeezes the knob of my cane even tighter and i have to bite my tongue to keep from cursing
a footman i say
what did he look like  blond hair tall but she drifts off looking troubled i dont know pleased with himself
probably works for a gentleman sir they get like that pick up airs and graces they do
had a broken nose all black and purple like it only recently happened
i reckon somebody took exception to him  what did you tell him  wasnt me sir was mrs drudge the cook
said the same thing she said to mrs derby that the servants were fine it was the guests gone – she blushes – oh begging your pardon sir i didnt mean  dont worry lucy i find most of the people in this house as peculiar as you do
what have they been doing  she grins her eyes darting towards the doors guiltily
when she speaks again her voice is almost low enough to be drowned out by the creaking of the floorboards
well this morning miss hardcastle was out in the forest with her ladys maid french she is you should hear her quelle this and quelle that
somebody attacked them out by charlie carvers old cottage
one of the guests apparently but they wouldnt say which one  attacked youre certain i say recalling my morning as bell and the woman i saw fleeing through the forest
i assumed it was anna but what if i was wrong
it wouldnt be the first assumption to trip me up in blackheath
thats what they said sir she says falling shy in the face of my eagerness
i think i need to have a chat with this french maid whats her name  madeline aubert sir only id prefer it if you didnt let on who told you
theyre keeping quiet about it  madeline aubert
thats the maid who gave bell the note at dinner last night
in the confusion of recent events id quite forgotten about his slashed arm
my lips are sealed lucy thank you i say miming the action
even so i must speak with her
could you let her know im looking for her
you dont have to tell her why but theres a reward in it for both of you if she comes to my parlour  she looks doubtful but agrees readily enough bolting before i have time to slip any more promises around her neck
if ravencourt were able id have a bounce in my step as i depart the gallery
whatever apathy evelyn may feel towards ravencourt shes still my friend and my will is still bent on saving her
if somebody threatened her in the forest this morning its not a stretch to assume the same person will play some part in her murder this evening
i must do everything in my power to intercept them and hopefully this madeline aubert will be able to help
who knows by this point tomorrow i might have the murderers name in hand
if the plague doctor honours his offer i could escape this house with hosts to spare
this jubilation persists only as far as the corridor my whistling faltering with each step further away from the brightness of the entrance hall
the footmans presence has transformed blackheath its leaping shadows and blind corners populating my imagination with a hundred horrible deaths at his hands
every little noise is enough to set my already overburdened heart racing
by the time i reach my parlour im soaked with sweat a knot in my chest
closing the door behind me i let out a long shuddering breath
at this rate the footman wont need to kill me my health will give out first
the parlours a beautiful room a chaise longue and an armchair beneath a chandelier reflecting the flames of a roaring fire
a sideboard is laid with spirits and mixers sliced fruit bitters and a bucket of halfmelted ice
beside that sits a teetering pile of roast beef sandwiches mustard running down the severed edges
my stomach would drag me towards the food but my bodys collapsing beneath me
i need to rest
the armchair takes my weight with ill temper the legs bowing under the strain
rains thumping the windows the sky bruised black and purple
are these the same drops that fell yesterday the same clouds
do rabbits dig the same warrens disturbing the same insects
do the same birds fly the same patterns crashing into the same windows
if this is a trap what kind of prey is worthy of it
i could do with a drink i mutter rubbing my throbbing temples
here you go says a woman from directly behind me the drink arriving over my shoulder in a small hand the fingers bony and calloused
i attempt to turn but theres too much of ravencourt and too little of the seat
the woman shakes the glass impatiently rattling the ice inside
you should drink this before the ice melts she says
youll forgive me if im suspicious of taking a drink from a woman i dont know i say
she lowers her lips to my ear her breath warm on my neck
but you do know me she whispers
i was in the carriage with the butler
my names anna  anna i say trying to raise myself from the seat
her hand is an anvil on my shoulder pushing me back down onto the cushions
dont bother by the time you get up ill be gone she says
well meet soon but i need you to stop looking for me  stop looking why  because youre not the only one searching she says withdrawing a little
the footmans hunting me as well and he knows were working together
if you keep looking youre going to lead him straight to me
were both safe while im hidden so call off the dogs  i feel her presence recede steps moving towards the far door
wait i cry
do you know who i am or why were here
please there must be something you can tell me  she pauses considering it
the only memory i woke up with was a name she says
i think its yours  my hands clutch the armrests
what was it i ask
aiden bishop she says
now ive done as you asked so do as i ask
stop looking for me      17   aiden bishop i say wrapping my tongue around the vowels
aiden bishop
aiden aiden aiden  ive been trying different combinations intonations and deliveries of my name for the last half hour hoping to lure some memories from my recalcitrant mind
thus far all ive managed to do is give myself a dry mouth
its a frustrating way to pass the time but ive few alternatives
onethirty has come and gone with no word from helena hardcastle to explain her absence
i summoned a maid to fetch her but was informed that nobodys seen the lady of the house since this morning
the damn woman has disappeared
to make matters worse neither cunningham nor madeline aubert has visited me and while id hardly expected evelyns maid to answer my summons cunninghams been gone for hours
i cant imagine whats keeping him but im growing impatient
weve so much to do and little time left to do it
 allo cecil says a rasping voice
is helena still here
i heard you were meeting her  standing at the door is an elderly lady buried beneath a huge red coat hat and mudspattered wellington boots that almost reach her knees
her cheeks are raw with cold a scowl frozen on her face
i havent seen her im afraid i say
im still waiting for her  you too eh
bloody woman was supposed to meet me in the garden this morning left me shivering on a bench for an hour instead she says stomping over to the fire
shes wearing so many layers a spark will send her up like a viking funeral
wonder where shes got to she says tugging off her gloves and tossing them on the seat next to mine
its not like theres a lot to do in blackheath
fancy a drink  still working on this one i say waving my glass in her direction
youve got the right idea
i got it into my head to go for a stroll but when i came back i couldnt get anybody to open the front door
ive been banging on windows for the last half hour but theres not a servant to be seen
the whole things positively american  decanters scrape free of their fittings glasses thumping down on the wood
ice tinkles against glass crackling as alcohol is poured on top
theres a fizz and a satisfying plop followed by a gulp and a long sigh of pleasure from the old lady
thats the stuff she says a fresh round of clinking glass suggesting the first was a warmup
i told helena this party was a terrible idea but she wouldnt hear of it and now look peters hiding in the gatehouse michaels holding the party together with his fingernails and evelyns playing dress up
the entire thing will be a disaster mark my words  drink in hand the elderly lady resumes her position in front of the fire
shes shrunken magnificently after discarding a few layers revealing pink cheeks and small pink hands a crop of grey hair running wild on her head
whats this then she says lifting a white card off the mantel
were you going to write to me cecil  sorry  she hands me the card a simple message written on the front
meet millicent derby  a  annas work no doubt
first burning gloves and now introductions
as strange as it is having somebody scattering breadcrumbs throughout my day its nice to know i have a friend in this place even if it does put paid to my theory about mrs derby being one of my rivals or even another host
this old ladys much too herself to be anybody else underneath
then why was she sniffing around the kitchen asking questions about the maids
i asked cunningham to invite you for drinks i say smoothly taking a sip of my whisky
he must have got distracted while writing the message down  thats what happens when you trust the lower classes with important tasks sniffs millicent dropping into a nearby chair
mark my words cecil one day youll find hes emptied your accounts and done a bunk with one of your maids
look at that damnable ted stanwin
used to waft about this place like a soft breeze when he was a groundskeeper now youd think he owns the place
the nerve of it  stanwins an objectionable fellow i agree but ive a soft spot for the household staff i say
theyve treated me with a great deal of kindness
besides word has it you were down in the kitchen earlier so you cant find them all bad  she waves her glass at me splashing whisky over my objection
oh that yes she trails off sipping her drink to buy herself time
i think one of the maids stole something from my room thats all
its like i say you never know whats going on underneath
remember my husband  vaguely i say admiring the elegance with which shes switched topic
whatever she was doing in the kitchen i doubt it had anything to do with theft
same thing she sniffs
dreadful lowerclass upbringing yet built himself fortyodd cotton mills without ever being anything less than an absolute ass
in fifty years of marriage i didnt smile till the day i buried him and havent stopped since  shes interrupted by a creaking sound from the corridor followed by the squeak of hinges
maybe thats helena says millicent pushing herself out of the chair
her room is next door  i thought the hardcastles were staying in the gatehouse  peters staying in the gatehouse she says raising an eyebrow
helenas staying here insisted on it by all accounts
was never much of a marriage but its disintegrating quickly
i tell you cecil it was worth coming for the scandal alone  the old lady heads into the corridor calling out helenas name only to fall suddenly silent
what on earth she mutters before poking her head into my parlour again
get up cecil she says nervously
something odd is going on  concern drags me to my feet and into the hall where helenas bedroom door creaks back and forth in a breeze
the lock has been shattered splinters of wood crunching underfoot
somebody broke in hisses millicent staying behind me
using my cane i slowly push the door open allowing us to peer inside
the rooms empty and has been for some time by the looks of things
the curtains are still drawn light delivered secondhand from the lamps lining the corridor
a fourposter bed is neatly made a vanity table is overflowing with face creams powders and cosmetics of every sort
satisfied that its safe millicent appears from behind me offering me a level glance best described as a belligerent apology before making her way around the bed to wrestle the heavy curtains open banishing the gloom
the only thing thats been disturbed is a chestnut bureau with a rolldown top its drawers hanging open
among the ink bottles envelopes and ribbons scattered on it theres a large lacquered case with two revolvershaped hollows in the cushion
the revolvers themselves are nowhere to be seen though i suspect evelyn brought one of them to the graveyard
she did say it was her mothers
well at least we know what they wanted says millicent tapping the case
doesnt make any damn sense though
if somebody wanted a gun they could just as easily steal one from the stables
theres dozens of them
nobody would bat an eyelid  pushing aside the case millicent unearths a moleskin dayplanner and begins leafing through the pages running her finger across the meetings and events reminders and notes crammed inside
the contents would suggest a busy if rather dull life if it werent for the tornout last page
thats curious todays appointments are missing she says her irritation giving way to suspicion
now why would helena rip those out  you believe she did it herself i say
what use would anybody else have for them says millicent
mark my words helena has something foolish in mind and she doesnt want anybody finding out about it
now if youll excuse me cecil im going to have to find her and talk her out of it
as usual  tossing the planner on the bed she stalks out of the bedroom and up the corridor
i barely notice her leave
im more concerned with the black smudged fingerprints on the pages
my valets been here and it appears hes looking for helena hardcastle as well
18   the worlds shrivelling beyond the windows darkening at the edges and blackening at the centre
the hunters are beginning to emerge from the forest waddling across the lawn like overgrown birds
having grown impatient in my parlour waiting for cunninghams return im heading to the library to inspect the encyclopaedia
its already a decision i regret
a day of walking has sapped all my strength this ponderous body growing heavier by the second
to make matters worse the house is alive with activity maids plumping cushions and arranging flowers darting this way and that like schools of startled fish
im embarrassed by their vigour cowed by their grace
by the time i enter the entrance hall its filled with hunters shaking the rain from their caps puddles forming at their feet
theyre soaking wet and grey with cold the life washed right out of them
theyve clearly endured a miserable afternoon
i pass through nervously my eyes downcast wondering if any of these scowling faces belongs to the footman
lucy harper told me he had a broken nose when he visited the kitchen which gives me some hope that my hosts are fighting back not to mention an easy way of picking him out
seeing no injuries i continue more confidently the hunters standing aside allowing me to shuffle through on my way to the library where the heavy curtains have been drawn and a fire set in the grate the air touched with a faint perfume
fat candles sit on plates plumes of warm light pockmarking the shadows illuminating three women curled up on chairs engrossed in the books open on their laps
heading to the bookshelf where the encyclopaedia should be i grope about in the darkness finding only an empty space
taking a candle from a nearby table i pass the flame across the shelf hoping it has been moved but its definitely gone
i let out a long breath deflating like the bellows of some awful contraption
until now i hadnt realised how much hope id invested in the encyclopaedia or in the idea of meeting my future hosts face to face
it wasnt only their knowledge i craved but the chance to study them as one might ones own twisted reflections in a hall of mirrors
surely in such observation id find some repeated quality a fragment of my true self carried through into each man unsullied by the personalities of their hosts
without that opportunity im not certain how to identify the edges of myself the dividing lines between my personality and that of my host
for all i know the only difference between myself and the footman is the mind im sharing
the days leaning on my shoulders forcing me into a chair opposite the fire
stacked logs pop and crackle heat shimmering and sagging in the air
my breath catches in my throat
among the flames lies the encyclopaedia burnt to ash but holding its shape a breath away from crumbling
the footmans work no doubt
i feel like ive been struck which was no doubt the intention
everywhere i go he seems to be a step ahead of me
and yet simply winning isnt enough
he needs me to know it
he needs me to be afraid
for some reason he needs me to suffer
still reeling from this blatant act of contempt i lose myself in the flames piling all my misgivings onto the bonfire until cunningham calls me from the doorway
lord ravencourt  where the devil have you been i snap my temper slipping away from me completely
he strolls around my chair taking a spot near the fire to warm his hands
he looks to have been caught in the storm and though hes changed his clothes his damp hair is still wild from the towel
its good to see ravencourts temper is still intact he says placidly
id feel positively adrift without my daily dressing down  dont play the victim with me i say wagging my finger at him
youve been gone hours  good work takes time he says tossing an object onto my lap
holding it up to the light i stare into the empty eyes of a porcelain beak mask my anger evaporating immediately
cunningham lowers his voice glancing at the woman who are watching us with open curiosity
it belongs to a chap called philip sutcliffe says cunningham
one of the servants spotted it in his wardrobe so i crept into his room when he left for the hunt
sure enough the top hat and greatcoat were in there as well along with a note promising to meet lord hardcastle at the ball
i thought we could intercept him  slapping my hand against my knee i grin at him like a maniac
good work cunningham good work indeed  i thought youd be happy he says
unfortunately thats where my good news ends
the note waiting for miss hardcastle at the well it was odd to say the least  odd how so i say holding the beak mask over my face
the porcelains cold clammy against my skin but aside from that its a good fit
the rain had smeared it but best i could tell it said stay away from millicent derby with a simple drawing of a castle beneath it
there was nothing else  thats a peculiar sort of warning i say
warning
i took it as a threat says cunningham
you think millicent derbys going to take after evelyn with her knitting needles i say raising an eyebrow
dont dismiss her because shes old he says prodding some life into the dwindling fire with a poker
at one time half the people in this house were under millicent derbys thumb
there wasnt a dirty secret she couldnt ferret out or a dirty trick she wouldnt use
ted stanwin was an amateur in comparison  youve had dealings with her  ravencourt has and he doesnt trust her he says
the mans a bastard but hes no fool  thats good to know i say
did you meet with sebastian bell  not yet ill catch him this evening
i wasnt able to turn over anything about the mysterious anna either  oh no need she found me earlier today i say picking at a loose piece of leather on the arm of the chair
really what did she want  she didnt say  well how does she know you  we didnt get around to it  is she a friend  possibly  profitable meeting then he says slyly replacing the poker on its stand
speaking of which we should get you into a bath
dinners at 8 pm and youre beginning to smell a bit ripe
lets not give people any more reason to dislike you than they already do  he moves to help me up but i wave him back
no i need you to shadow evelyn for the rest of the evening i say struggling to raise myself from the chair
gravity it seems is opposed to the idea
to what end he asks frowning at me
somebodys planning to murder her i say
yes and that somebody could be me for all you know he says blandly as though suggesting nothing more important than a fondness for music halls
the idea strikes me with such force i drop back into the seat ive halfescaped the wood cracking beneath me
ravencourt trusts cunningham completely a trait ive adopted without question despite knowing he has a terrible secret
hes as much a suspect as anybody
cunningham taps his nose
now youre thinking he says sliding my arm over his shoulders
ill find bell when ive got you into the bath but to my mind youre better off shadowing evelyn yourself when youre next able
in the meantime ill stick by your side so you can rule me out as a suspect
my lifes complicated enough without having eight of you chasing me around the house accusing me of murder  you seem well versed in this sort of thing i say trying to scrutinise his reaction from the corner of my eye
well i wasnt always a valet he says
and what were you  i dont believe that information was part of our little arrangement he says a grimace on his face as he tries to lift me
then why dont you tell me what you were doing in helena hardcastles bedroom i suggest
you smeared the ink while you were rifling through her dayplanner
i noticed it on your hands this morning  he lets out a whistle of astonishment
you have been busy his voice hardens
strange you havent heard about my scandalous relationship to the hardcastles then
oh i wouldnt want to spoil the surprise for you
ask around its not exactly a secret and im sure somebody will get a thrill from telling you  did you break in cunningham i demand
two revolvers were taken and a page torn from her dayplanner  i didnt have to break in i was invited he says
couldnt tell you about those revolvers but the dayplanner was whole when i left
saw it myself
i suppose i could explain what i was doing there and why im not your man but if youve got any sense you wouldnt believe a word of it so you might as well find out for yourself
that way you can be certain its the truth  we rise in a damp cloud of sweat cunningham dabbing the perspiration from my forehead before handing me my cane
tell me cunningham i say
why does a man like you settle for a job like this  that brings him up short his normally implacable face darkening
life doesnt always leave you a choice in how you live it he says grimly
now come on weve a murder to attend      19   the evening meal is lit by candelabra and beneath their flickering glow lies a graveyard of chicken bones fish spines lobster shells and pork fat
the curtains remain undrawn despite the darkness beyond granting a view towards the forest being whipped by the storm
i can hear myself eating the crush and the crack the squelch and the gulp
gravy runs down my chins grease smearing my lips with a ghastly shimmering shine
such is the ferocity of my appetite that i leave myself panting between mouthfuls my napkin resembling a battlefield
the other diners are watching this hideous performance from the corner of their eyes trying to maintain their conversations even as the decorum of the evening crunches between my teeth
how can a man know such hunger
what hollowness must he be trying to fill
michael hardcastles sitting to the left of me though weve barely spoken two words since i arrived
hes spent most of his time in hushed conversation with evelyn heads bowed close their affection impenetrable
for a woman who knows herself to be in danger she seems remarkably unperturbed
perhaps she believes herself protected
have you ever travelled to the orient my lord ravencourt  if only the seat to my right was similarly oblivious to my presence
its filled by commander clifford herrington a balding former naval officer in a uniform glittering with valour
after an hour spent in his company im struggling to reconcile the man with the deeds
perhaps its the weak chin and averted gaze the sense of imminent apology
more likely its the scotch sloshing around behind his eyes
herringtons spent the evening tossing around tedious stories without bothering to indulge in the courtesy of exaggeration and now it appears our conversation is washing up on the shores of asia
i sip my wine to cover my agitation discovering the taste to be peculiarly piquant
my grimace causes herrington to lean over conspiratorially
i had the same reaction he says hitting me full in the face with his warm alcoholsoaked breath
i quizzed a servant on the vintage
might as well have asked the glass i was drinking it out of  the candelabra gives his face a ghoulish yellow cast and theres a drunken sheen to his eyes thats repellent
putting my wine down i cast about for some distraction
there must be fifteen people around the table words of french spanish and german seasoning otherwise dull conversational fare
expensive jewellery clinks against glass cutlery rattles as waiters remove plates
the mood in the room is sombre the scattered conversations hushed and urgent spoken across a dozen empty seats
its an eerie sight mournful even and though the absences are notable everybody seems to be going out of their way to avoid noting them
i cant tell whether its a matter of good breeding or theres some explanation ive missed
i search for familiar faces to ask but cunninghams gone to meet bell and theres no sign of millicent derby doctor dickie or even the repulsive ted stanwin
aside from evelyn and michael the only other person i recognise is daniel coleridge whos sitting near a thin fellow at the far end of the table the two of them eyeing the other guests from behind their halffilled wine glasses
somebodys taken exception to that handsome face of daniels adorning it with a split lip and a swollen eye that will be frightful tomorrow assuming tomorrow ever actually arrives
the injury doesnt appear to be bothering him unduly though it unsettles me
until this moment id considered daniel immune to the machinations of this place assuming his knowledge of the future allowed him to simply sidestep misfortune
seeing him brought so low is like seeing the cards spilling out of a magicians sleeve
his dining companion thumps the table in delight at one of daniels jokes drawing my attention
i feel as though i know this fellow but i cant place him
a future host perhaps
i certainly hope not
hes a smear of a man with oiled hair and a pale pinched face his manner that of somebody who finds everything in the room beneath him
i sense cunning in him cruelty too though i cant understand from where im gathering these impressions
they have such outlandish remedies says clifford herrington raising his voice slightly to reclaim my attention
i blink at him in confusion
the orientals lord ravencourt he says smiling amiably
of course i say
no im afraid ive never visited  incredible place incredible
they have these hospitals  i raise my hand to attract a servant
if i cant be spared the conversation i can at least be spared the wine
one mercy may yet yield another
i was speaking with doctor bell last night about some of their opiates he continues
make it end  is the food to your satisfaction lord ravencourt says michael hardcastle neatly sidling into the conversation
i turn my eyes to meet him gratitude flooding forth
a glass of red wine is half raised to his lips mischief sparkling in those green eyes
its a stark contrast to evelyn whose gaze could tear strips from my skin
shes dressed in a blue evening gown and tiara her blonde hair pinned up in curls exposing the lavish diamond necklace draped around her neck
its the same outfit minus an overcoat and wellington boots that shell be wearing when she accompanies sebastian bell into the graveyard later this evening
dabbing my lips i bow my head
its excellent im just sorry there arent more people to enjoy it i say gesturing towards the empty seats scattered around the table
i was particularly looking forward to meeting mr sutcliffe  and his plague doctor costume i think to myself
well youre in luck interrupts clifford herrington
old sutcliffes a good friend of mine perhaps i can introduce you at the ball  assuming he makes it says michael
he and my father will have reached the back of the liquor cabinet by now
doubtless mothers trying to rouse them as we speak  is lady hardcastle coming tonight i ask
i hear she hasnt been seen much today  returning to blackheath has been hard on her says michael lowering his voice as though sharing a confidence
no doubt shes spent the day exorcising a few ghosts before the party
rest assured shell be here  were interrupted by one of the waiters leaning down to whisper in michaels ear
the young mans expression immediately darkens and as the waiter retreats he passes the message to his sister the gloom washing over her face as well
they look at each other a moment squeezing hands before michael raps on his wine glass with a fork and gets to his feet
he seems to unfurl as he stands so that he now appears unfeasibly tall reaching well beyond the dim light of the candelabra forcing him to speak from the shadows
the room is silent all eyes upon him
id rather hoped my parents might make an appearance and save me from making a toast he says
clearly theyre planning some grand entrance at the ball which knowing my parents will be very grand indeed  muted laughter is met with a shy smile
my gaze skips across the guests running straight into daniels amused stare
dabbing his lips with a napkin he flicks his eyes towards michael instructing me to pay attention
he knows whats coming
my father wanted to thank you for attending tonight and im sure hell do so in great detail later says michael
theres a quiver in his voice the slightest hint of discomfort
in his stead id like to extend my personal thanks to each of you for coming and to welcome my sister evelyn back home after her time in paris  she reflects his adoration the two of them sharing a smile that has nothing to do with this room or these people
even so glasses are raised reciprocal thanks washing back along the table
michael waits for the commotion to die down then continues
shell soon be embarking on a brandnew adventure and he pauses eyes on the table well shes going to be married to lord cecil ravencourt  silence engulfs us all eyes turning in my direction
shock becomes confusion then disgust their faces a perfect reflection of my own feelings
there must be thirty years and a thousand meals between ravencourt and evelyn whose hostility this morning is now explained
if lord and lady hardcastle really do blame their daughter for thomass death their punishment is exquisite
they plan to steal all the years from her that were stolen from thomas
i look over at evelyn but shes fidgeting with a napkin and biting her lip her former humour having fled
a bead of sweat is rolling down michaels forehead the wine shaking in his glass
he cant even look at his sister and she cant look anywhere else
never has a man found a tablecloth so engrossing as i do now
lord ravencourts an old friend of the family says michael mechanically soldiering on into the silence
i cant think of anybody whod take better care of my sister  finally he looks at evelyn meeting her glistening eyes
evie i think you wanted to say something  she nods the napkin strangled in her hands
all eyes are fixed on her nobody moving
even the servants are staring standing by the walls holding dirty plates and fresh bottles of wine
finally evelyn looks up from her lap meeting the expectant faces arranged before her
her eyes are wild like an animal caught in a trap
whatever words she prepared they desert her immediately replaced with a wretched sob that drives her from the room michael chasing after her
among the rustle of bodies turning in my direction i seek out daniel
the amusement of earlier has passed his gaze now fixed on the window
i wonder how many times hes watched the slow blush rise up my cheeks if he even remembers how this shame felt
is that why he cant look at me now
will i do any better when my time comes
abandoned at the end of the table my instinct is to flee with michael and evelyn but i might as well wish for the moon to reach down and pluck me from this chair
silence swirls until clifford herrington gets to his feet candlelight glinting off his naval medals as he raises his glass
to many happy years he says seemingly without irony
one by one every glass is raised and the toast repeated in a hollow chant
at the end of the table daniel winks at me
20   the dining hall has long emptied of guests the servants having finally cleared away the last of the platters when cunningham comes to collect me
hes been standing outside for over an hour but every time hes tried to enter ive waved him back
after the humiliation of dinner having anybody see my valet help me from my seat would be an indignity too far
when he does stroll in theres a smirk on his face
no doubt word of my shaming has run laps around the house fat old ravencourt and his runaway bride
why didnt you tell me about ravencourts marriage to evelyn i demand stopping him in his tracks
to humiliate you he says
i stiffen my cheeks reddening as he meets my gaze
his eyes are green the pupils uneven like splashed ink
i see conviction enough to raise armies and burn churches
god help ravencourt should this boy ever decide to stop being his footstool
ravencourt is a vain man easy to embarrass continues cunningham in a level voice
i noticed youd inherited this quality and i made sport of it  why i ask stunned by his honesty
you blackmailed me he says shrugging
you didnt think id take that lying down did you  i blink at him for a few seconds before laughter erupts out of me
its a belly laugh the rolls of my flesh shaking in appreciation at his audacity
i humiliated him and he handed back an equal weight of that misery using nothing more than patience
what man wouldnt be charmed by such a feat
cunningham frowns at me his eyebrows knitting together
youre not angry he asks
i suspect my anger is of little concern to you i say wiping a tear from my eye
regardless i threw the first stone
i cant complain if a boulder comes back at me  my mirth prompts an echoing smile in my companion
it appears there are some differences between yourself and lord ravencourt after all he says measuring each word
not least a name i say holding out my hand
mine is aiden bishop  he shakes it firmly his smile deepening
very good to make your acquaintance aiden im charles  well i have no intention of telling anybody your secret charles and i apologise for threatening it
i wish only to save evelyn hardcastles life and escape blackheath and i dont have a lot of time to do either
ill need a friend  probably more than one he says cleaning his glasses on his sleeve
in all honesty this tales so peculiar im not sure i could walk away now even if i wished to  shall we go then i say
by daniels reckoning evelyn will be murdered at the party at 11 pm
if were to save her thats where we have to be  the ballroom is on the other side of the entrance hall cunningham supporting me at the elbow as we walk there
carriages are arriving from the village queuing up on the gravel outside
horses nicker footmen opening the doors for costumed guests who flutter like canaries released from their cages
why is evelyn being compelled to marry ravencourt i whisper to cunningham
money he says
lord hardcastles got an eye for a bad investment and not nearly enough intelligence to learn from his mistakes
rumour suggests hes driving the family towards bankruptcy
in return for evelyns hand lord and lady hardcastle will receive a rather generous dowry and ravencourts promise to buy blackheath in a couple of years for a tidy sum  so thats it i say
the hardcastles are hard up and theyre pawning their daughter off like old jewellery  my thoughts flock back to this mornings chess game the smile on evelyns face as i winced out of the sun room
ravencourt isnt buying a bride hes buying a bottomless well of spite
i wonder if the old fool understands what hes getting into
and what of sebastian bell i say remembering the task i set him
did you speak with him  afraid not the poor fellow was passed out on the floor of his room when i arrived he says genuine pity in his voice
i saw the dead rabbit seems your footman has a twisted sense of humour
i called for the doctor and left them to it
your experiment will have to wait another day  my disappointment is drowned out by the music beating at the ballrooms closed doors the sound tumbling into the hall when a servant sweeps them open for us
there must be at least fifty people inside whirling through a soft puddle of light cast by a chandelier wreathed in candles
an orchestra is playing with bravado on a stage pressed against the far wall but the majority of the room has been given over to the dance floor where harlequins in full livery court egyptian queens and grinning devils
jesters leap and mock dislodging powdered wigs and gold masks held up on long sticks
dresses capes and cowls swoop and swish across the floor the crush of bodies disorientating
the only space to be found surrounds michael hardcastle in his dazzling sun mask its pointed rays extending such a distance from his face that its unsafe to venture anywhere near him
were viewing all this from a mezzanine a small staircase leading down to the dance floor
my fingers are rapping the banister keeping time with the music
some part of me the part thats still ravencourt knows this song and is enjoying it
he yearns to pick up an instrument and play
ravencourts a musician i ask cunningham
in his youth he says
talented violinist by all accounts
broke his arm riding and could never play as well again
he still misses it i think  he does i say surprised by the depth of his longing
putting it aside i return my attention to the matter at hand but i have no idea how were going to spot sutcliffe among the crowd
or the footman
my heart sinks
i hadnt considered that
amid the noise and the crush of bodies a blade could do its work and vanish without anybody ever being the wiser
such thoughts would have caused bell to flee back to his room but ravencourt is made of sterner stuff
if this is where the attempt will be made on evelyns life this is where i must be come what may and so with charles supporting my arm we descend the stairs keeping to the shadowy edges of the ballroom
clowns slap me on the back and women swirl in front of me butterfly masks in hand
i ignore much of it pushing my way to the couches near the french doors where i can better rest my weary legs
until now id only witnessed my fellow guests in their handfuls their spite spread thin across the house
to be ensnared among them all as i am now is something else entirely and the further i descend into the uproar the thicker their malice seems to become
most of the men look to have spent the afternoon soaking in their cups and are staggering instead of dancing snarling and staring their conduct savage
young women throw their heads back and laugh their makeup running and hair coming loose as theyre passed from body to body goading a small group of wives whove grouped together for safety wary of these panting wildeyed creatures
nothing like a mask to reveal somebodys true nature
beside me charles has grown increasingly tense his fingers digging deeper into my forearm with every step
all of this is wrong
the celebration is too desperate
this is the last party before gomorrah fell
we reach a couch charles lowering me onto the cushions
waitresses are moving through the crowd with trays of drinks but its proving impossible to signal them from our position on the fringe of the party
its too loud to talk but he points towards the champagne table guests are stumbling away from arm in arm
i nod dabbing the sweat from my forehead
perhaps a drink will serve to settle my nerves
as he leaves to fetch a bottle i feel a breeze on my skin and notice that somebody has opened the french doors presumably to let a little air circulate
its pitchblack outside but braziers have been lit the flickering flames winding all the way up to a reflecting pool surrounded by trees
the darkness swirls taking shape solidifying as it sweeps inside candlelight dripping onto a pale face
not a face a mask
a white porcelain beak mask
i look around for charles hoping hes near enough to lay hands on the fellow but the crowd has carried him away
looking back towards the french doors i see the plague doctor slipping through the revellers shoulder first
gripping my cane i heave myself to my feet
wrecks have been raised from the ocean bed with less effort but i hobble towards the cascade of costumes shrouding my quarry
i follow glimpses – the glint of a mask the swirl of a cloak – but hes fog in a forest impossible to snatch hold of
i lose him somewhere in the far corner
turning on the spot i try to catch sight of him but somebody comes clattering into me
i bellow in fury finding myself looking into a pair of brown eyes peering out from behind a porcelain beak mask
my heart leaps and so do i evidently for the mask is swiftly removed to reveal the pinched boyish face behind
gosh im sorry he says
i didnt  rochester rochester over here somebody yells to him
we turn at the same time another fellow in a plague doctor costume approaching us
theres another behind him three more in the crowd
my quarry has multiplied yet none of them can be my interlocutor
theyre too stout and short too tall and thin too many imperfect copies of the real thing
they try to drag their friend away but i catch hold of the nearest arm – any arm theyre all the same
where did you get these costumes i ask
the fellow scowls at me his grey eyes bloodshot
theyre lightless expressionless
empty doorways without a coherent thought behind them
shaking himself loose of my grip he prods me in the chest
ask me nicely he slurs drunkenly
hes itching for a fight and lashing out with my cane i give it to him
the heavy wood catches him on the leg a curse detonating on his lips as he drops to one knee
attempting to steady himself he places his palm flat on the dance floor the point of my cane landing on top of his hand pinning him to the ground
the costumes i shout
where did you find them  the attic he says his face now as pale as the discarded mask
theres dozens of them hanging on a rack  he strains to free himself but only a fraction of my weight is resting on the cane
i add a little more pain unsettling his features
how did you know about them i ask taking a little pressure off his hand
a servant found us last night he says tears forming in his eyes
he was already wearing one mask and hat the entire getup
we didnt have costumes so he took us up to the attic to find some
he was helping everybody must have been two dozen people up there i swear  seems the plague doctor doesnt want to be found
i watch him squirm for a second or two balancing the veracity of his story against the pain on his face
content that the two are of equal weight i lift my cane allowing him to stumble away clutching his aching hand
hes barely out of my sight before michael emerges from the crowd spotting me at a distance and driving straight towards me
hes flustered two red spots on his cheeks
his mouth is moving frantically but his words are lost in the music and laughter
i signal that i cannot understand and he comes closer
have you seen my sister he yells
i shake my head suddenly fearful
i can see in his eyes that something is wrong but before i can quiz him further hes pushing back through the whirling dancers
hot and giddy oppressed by a sense of foreboding i fight my way to my seat removing my bow tie and loosening my collar
masked figures drift by naked arms glittering with perspiration
i feel nauseous unable to take pleasure in anything i see
im contemplating joining the search for evelyn when cunningham returns with a bottle of champagne in a silver bucket crammed with ice and two longstemmed glasses tucked under his arm
the metals sweating as is cunningham
its been so long id quite forgotten what hed left to do and i yell into his ear
where have you been  thought saw sutcliffe he yells back about half the words carrying through the music  costume  evidently cunninghams had much the same experience i had
nodding my understanding we sit and drink silently keeping our eyes open for evelyn my frustration mounting
i need to be on my feet searching the house questioning guests but ravencourts incapable of such feats
this room is too crowded his body too weary
hes a man of calculation and observation not action and if im to help evelyn these are the skills i must embrace
tomorrow ill dash but today i must watch
i need to see everything thats happening in this ballroom cataloguing every detail in order to get ahead of this evenings events
the champagne calms me but i put my glass down wary of dulling my faculties
thats when i spot michael climbing the few steps that lead to the mezzanine overlooking the ballroom
the orchestra is silenced the laughter and chatter slowly dying down as all heads turn towards their host
im sorry to interrupt says michael gripping the banister i feel foolish for asking but does anybody know where my sister is  a ripple of conversation washes over the crowd as heads turn to look at one another
it takes only a minute to determine shes not in the ballroom
its cunningham who spots her first
touching my arm he points towards evelyn whos weaving drunkenly as she follows the braziers towards the reflecting pool
shes some distance away already drifting in and out of the light
a small silver pistols glinting in her hand
fetch michael i cry
as cunningham pushes through the crowd i drag myself to my feet lurching towards the window
nobody else has seen her and the commotions building again the temporary fuss of the announcement already fading
the violin player tests a note the clock shows 11 pm  ive reached the french doors when evelyn arrives at the pool
shes swaying trembling
standing in the trees only feet away the plague doctor watches passively the flames of the brazier reflected on his mask
the silver pistol flashes as evelyn raises it to her stomach the gunshot slicing through conversation and music
and yet for a moment all seems well
evelyns still standing on the edge of the water as though admiring her reflection
then her legs buckle the gun dropping from her hand as she topples face first into the pool the plague doctor bowing his head and disappearing into the blackness of the trees
im only dimly aware of the screams or the crowd at my back surging past me onto the grass as the promised fireworks explode in the air drenching the pool in colourful light
im watching michael sprinting into the darkness towards a sister hes too late to save
hes screaming her name his voice drowned out by the fireworks as he wades into the inky water to scoop up her body
slipping and stumbling he tries to drag her from the pool before eventually collapsing evelyn still cradled in his arms
kissing her face he begs her to open her eyes but its a fools hope
deaths rolled his dice and evelyns paid her debt
all that was of value has been taken
burying his face in her wet hair michael sobs
hes oblivious as the crowd gather as strong arms pry him from his sisters limp body hoisting her onto the grass so doctor dickie can kneel down and make his examination
not that his skills are required the hole in her stomach and the silver pistol on the grass tell the story eloquently enough
despite that he lingers over her pressing his fingers to her neck to check for a pulse before tenderly wiping the dirty water from her face
still kneeling he gestures for michael to come closer and taking the weeping mans hand he bows his head and begins muttering what looks to be a prayer under his breath
im grateful for his reverence
a few women are crying into accommodating shoulders but theres something hollow about their performance
its as though the ball hasnt really ended
theyre all still dancing theyve just changed the steps
evelyn deserves better than to be entertainment for people she despised
the doctor seems to understand this his every action no matter how small restoring some small part of her dignity
the prayer only takes a minute and when its done he drapes his jacket across evelyns face as though her unblinking stare is of greater offence than the blood staining her dress
theres a tear on his cheek as he gets to his feet and placing an arm around michael he leads evelyns sobbing brother away
to my eyes they depart older men slower and more bent carrying a great weight of sadness across their shoulders
no sooner are they inside the house than rumours bounce through the crowd
the police are coming a suicide notes been found charlie carvers spirit has claimed another hardcastle child
the stories are spun from one mouth to another and by the time they reach me theyre rich with details and patterns strong enough to be carried out of here and into society
i look for cunningham but hes nowhere to be seen
i cant imagine what he could be doing but hes got a quick eye and willing hands so no doubt hes found a purpose – unlike myself
the shot has shattered my nerves
taking myself back to the now empty ballroom i drop onto the couch from earlier where i sit and tremble my mind racing
i know my friend will be alive again tomorrow but it doesnt change what happened or the devastation i feel at having witnessed it
evelyn took her own life and im responsible
her marriage to ravencourt was a punishment a humiliation designed to push her over the edge and however unwittingly i was part of it
it was my face she hated my presence that drove her to the waters edge with a pistol in her hand
and what of the plague doctor
he offered me freedom in return for solving a murder that wouldnt look like a murder but i watched evelyn shoot herself after fleeing a dinner in despair
there can be no doubt about her actions or motivation which makes me wonder at my captors
was his offer just another torment a slither of hope to go mad chasing
what about the graveyard
the gun
if evelyn were truly so despondent why did she seem in such good cheer when she accompanied bell into the graveyard less than two hours after the dinner
and what about the gun she was carrying
it was a large black revolver almost too big for her clutch bag
the gun she used to take her life was a silver pistol
why would she change weapons
i dont know how long i sit there thinking about it amid the delighted mourners but the police never come
the crowds thin and the candles gutter the party flickers and goes out
the last thing i see before falling asleep in my chair is the image of michael hardcastle kneeling on the grass cradling the drippingwet body of his dead sister
21   day two continued  pain stirs me every breath painful
blinking away the tatters of sleep i see a white wall white sheets and a blossom of crusted blood on the pillow
my cheek is resting on my hand saliva sticking my top lip to my knuckles
i know this moment i saw it through bells eyes
im in the butler again after he was moved to the gatehouse
somebodys pacing beside my bed a maid judging by the black dress and white apron
theres a large book held open in her arms which shes flipping through furiously
my heads too heavy to see anything above her waist so i groan to call her over
oh good youre awake she says halting her pacing
whens ravencourt going to be alone
you didnt write it down but the bloody idiot has his valet nosing around the kitchen  who are my throat is clogged with blood and phlegm
theres a jug of water on the sideboard and the maid hurries over to pour me some placing her book on the counter while she tips a glass to my lips
i move my head a fraction trying to look up at her face but the world immediately starts to spin
you shouldnt talk she says using her apron to wipe a stray drop of water from my chin
she pauses
i mean you can talk but only when youre ready  she pauses again
actually i really need you to answer my question about ravencourt before he gets me killed  who are you i croak
how hard did that ape wait she lowers her face to my own her brown eyes searching for something
shes puffycheeked and pale with strands of tangled blonde hair straying free from her cap
with a start i realise this is the maid bell and evelyn met the one who was keeping watch on the butler
how may hosts have you had she asks
i dont  how many hosts she insists sitting on the edge of the bed
how many bodies have you been in  youre anna i say twisting my neck to get a better look at her the pain setting fire to my bones
very gently she presses me back down onto the mattress
yes im anna she says patiently
how many hosts  tears of joy prod my eyes affection washing through me like warm water
even though i cant remember this woman i can feel the years of friendship between us a trust that borders on instinct
more than that im overcome by the simple joy of this reunion
as strange as it is to say about somebody i cant remember i now realise ive missed her
seeing the emotion on my face answering tears form in annas eyes and leaning down she hugs me gently
ive missed you too she says voicing my feeling
we stay like that for a while before she clears her throat and wipes the tears away
well thats enough of that she sniffs
crying on each other isnt going to help
i need you to tell me about your hosts or cryings all well do  i
i im struggling to speak through the lump in my throat
i woke up as bell then the butler then donald davies the butler again ravencourt and now  the butler again she says thoughtfully
third times a charm aint it  stroking a lock of disturbed hair from my forehead she leans closer
i take it we havent been introduced yet or at least you havent been introduced to me she says
my names anna and youre aiden bishop or have we done that part already
you keep arriving in the wrong order i never know where were up to  youve met my other selves  they pop in and out she says glancing at the door as voices sound somewhere in the house
usually with a favour to ask  what about your hosts are they  i dont have other hosts its just me she says
no visits from a plague doctor no other days neither
i wont remember any of this tomorrow which seems a bit of luck given how todays going so far  but you know whats happening you know about evelyns suicide  its murder and i woke up knowing she says straightening my sheets
couldnt remember my own name but i knew yours and i knew there was no escaping until we took the killers name and proof of their guilt to the lake at 11 pm theyre like rules i think
words scraped onto my brain so i dont forget  i didnt remember anything when i woke up i respond trying to understand why our torments would be different
aside from your name the plague doctor had to tell me everything  course he did youre his special project she says adjusting my pillow
doesnt give a rats fart about what im doing
havent heard a peep out of him all day
wont leave you alone though
surprised hes not waiting under that bed  he told me only one of us can escape i say
yeah and its pretty bloody obvious he wants it to be you she says the anger draining from her voice as quickly as it came
she shakes her head
sorry i shouldnt be taking any of this out on you but i cant shift the feeling hes up to something and i dont like it  i know what you mean i say
but if only one of us can escape  why are we helping each other she interrupts
because youve got a plan to get us both out  i have  well you said you did  for the first time her confidence falters a worried frown appearing on her face but before i can press the issue wood creaks in the corridor steps thumping up the stairs
it feels like the entire house is shaking with their ascent
just a tick she says collecting the book from the counter
only now do i realise its actually an artists sketchbook the brown leather covers filled with sheets of looseleaf paper untidily bound by string
hiding the book under the bed she comes up instead with a shotgun
pressing the butt against her shoulder she stalks over to the door opening it a crack to better hear the commotion outside
oh hell says anna kicking the door closed with her foot
its the doctor with your sedative
quick whens ravencourt going to be alone
i need to tell him to stop searching for me  why whos  we dont have time aiden she says sliding the shotgun back under the bed out of sight
ill be here next time you wake up and we can have a proper talk then i promise but for now tell me about ravencourt every detail you can remember  shes leaning over me clutching my hand her eyes pleading
hell be in his parlour at 115 pm i say
you hand him a whisky have a chat and then millicent derby arrives
you leave him a card introducing her  she squeezes her eyes shut mouthing the time and name over and over again carving them into her memory
only now her features smoothed by concentration do i realise how young she is no more than nineteen id guess though hard labours added a few years to the pile
one more thing she hisses cupping my cheek her face so close to mine i can see the amber flecks in her brown eyes
if you see me out there pretend you dont know me
dont even come near me if you can help it
theres this footman ill tell you about him later or earlier
point is its dangerous for us to be seen together
any talking needs doing well do it in here  she kisses me on the forehead quickly offering the room a last glance to make sure everythings in order
the steps have reached the hall two sets of voices jumbled up and rolling on ahead
i recognise dickie but not the second one
its deep urgent though i cant quite make out whats being said
whos with dickie i ask
lord hardcastle most like she says
hes been popping in and out all morning to check on you  that makes sense
evelyn told me the butler was lord hardcastles batman during the war
their closeness is the reason gregory gold is strung up in the room opposite
are things always like this i ask
the explanations arriving before the questions  i wouldnt know she says standing up and smoothing her apron
two hours ive been at this and all ive had are orders  doctor dickie opens the door his moustache just as preposterous as the first time i saw it
his gaze passes from anna to myself and back again as he tries to stitch together the torn edges of our hastily severed conversation
no answers forthcoming he places his black medical bag on the sideboard and comes to stand over me
awake i see he says rocking back and forth on his heels fingers thrust into the watch pockets of his waistcoat
leave us girl he says to anna who curtsies before exiting the room casting me a quick glance on her way out
so how are you feeling he asks
no worse for wear from the carriage journey i hope  not bad i begin to say but he lifts the covers raising my arm to take my pulse
even this gentle action is enough to cause spasms of pain the rest of my response mangled by a wince
little sore hmmm he says lowering my arm once more
hardly surprising given the beating you took
any notion what this fellow gregory gold wanted from you  i dont
must have mistook me for somebody else sir  the sir isnt my doing its an old habit of the butlers and im surprised by how easily it arrived on my tongue
the doctors shrewd gaze holds my explanation up to the light poking a dozen different holes in it
the tight smile he flashes me is one of complicity both reassuring and a touch threatening
whatever happened in that hallway the seemingly benign doctor dickie knows more about it than hes letting on
theres a click as he opens his bag withdrawing a brown bottle and a hypodermic syringe
keeping his eyes on me he pokes the needle through the bottles wax seal filling the hypodermic with a clear liquid
my hand clutches the sheets
im fine doctor honestly i say
yes thats rather my concern he says jabbing the needle into my neck before i have a chance to argue
a warm liquid floods my veins drowning my thoughts
the doctor melts colours blossoming and fading into darkness
sleep roger he says
ill deal with mr gold      22   day five  coughing up a lungful of cigar smoke i open a new pair of eyes to find myself almost fully clothed on wooden floorboards one hand lying victorious on an untouched bed
my trousers are around my ankles a bottle of brandy clutched to my stomach
clearly an attempt was made at undressing last night but such a course appears to have been beyond my new host whose breath stinks like an old beer mat
groaning i claw my way up the side of the bed dislodging a throbbing headache that nearly knocks me to the floor again
im in a similar bedroom to the one bell was given the embers of last nights fire winking at me from the grate
the curtains are open the sky sagging with early morning light
evelyns in the forest you need to find her
hoisting my trousers up to my waist i stumble over to the mirror to better inspect this fool i now inhabit
i nearly run straight into it
after being shackled to ravencourt for so long this new chap feels weightless a leaf being blown about by a breeze
its not too surprising when i see him in the glass
hes short and slight somewhere in his late twenties with longish brown hair and bloodshot blue eyes above a neatly trimmed beard
i try out his smile discovering a row of slightly awkward white teeth
its the face of a rascal
my possessions are sitting in a pile on the bedside table an invitation addressed to jonathan derby on top
at least i know who to curse for this hangover
i sift through the items with a fingertip uncovering a pocketknife a weathered hip flask a wristwatch showing 843 am and three brown vials with cork stoppers and no labels
yanking a cork loose i sniff the liquid within my stomach twisting at the sickly sweet scent that drifts out
this must be the laudanum bell was selling
i can see why its so popular
simply sniffing the stuff has filled my mind with bright lights
theres a jug of cold water beside a small sink in the corner and stripping naked i wash off last nights sweat and grime digging out the person beneath
whats left of the water i tip to my mouth drinking until my belly sloshes
unfortunately my attempts to drown the hangover only dilute it aches seeping into every bone and muscle
its a foul morning so i dress in the thickest clothes i can find hunting tweeds and a heavy black coat that trails along the floor as i leave the bedroom
despite the early hour a drunken couple is squabbling at the top of the stairs
theyre in last nights evening wear drinks still clutched in their hands accusations passed back and forth in escalating voices and i give their flailing arms a wide berth as i walk by
their bickering chases me into the entrance hall which has been upended by the previous evenings escapades
bow ties are dangling from the chandelier leaves and shards of a smashed decanter littering the marble floor
two maids are cleaning it up leaving me to wonder what it must have looked like before they started
i try asking them where charlie carvers cottage is located but theyre mute as sheep lowering their eyes and shaking their heads in response to my questions
their silence is maddening
if lucy harpers gossip isnt too far from the mark evelyns going to be somewhere near the cottage with her ladys maid when shes attacked
if i can discover whos threatening her perhaps i can save her life and escape this house all at the same time – though i have no clue as to how im going to help free anna as well
shes put aside her own schemes to aid me believing i have some plan that will free us both
for the moment i cant see how thats anything other than a hollow promise and judging by her worried frown when we talked in the gatehouse shes beginning to suspect as much
my only hope is that my future hosts are a great deal cleverer than my previous ones
further questioning of the maids drives them deeper into their silence forcing me to look around for help
the rooms either side of the entrance hall are deathly quiet the house still kneedeep in last night and seeing no other option i pick my way through the broken glass and head below stairs towards the kitchen
the passage to the kitchen is grimier than i remember the clatter of dishes and smell of roasting meat making me sick
servants eye me as they pass turning their heads away whenever i open my mouth to ask a question
its clear they think i shouldnt be here and just as clear they dont know how to get rid of me
this is their place a river of unguarded conversations and giggling gossip flowing beneath the house
i sully it with my presence
agitation rubs me up and down blood thumping in my ears
i feel tired and raw the air made of sandpaper
can i help you says a voice behind me
the words are rolled up and flung at my back
i turn to find the cook mrs drudge staring up at me ample hands on ample hips
through these eyes she looks like something a child might make out of clay a small head on a misshapen body her features pressed into her face by clumsy thumbs
shes stern no trace of the woman whos going to give the butler a warm scone in a couple of hours time
im looking for evelyn hardcastle i say meeting her fierce gaze
she went for a walk in the forest with madeline aubert her ladys maid  and whats that to you  her tone is so abrupt i almost recoil
clenching my hands i try to keep hold of my rising temper
the servants crane their necks as they scurry by desperate for theatre but terrified of the star
somebody means her harm i say through gritted teeth
if youll point me towards charlie carvers old cottage ill be able to warn her  is that what you were doing with madeline last night
warning her
is that how her blouse got torn is that why she was crying  a vein pulses in her forehead indignation bubbling beneath every word
she takes a step forwards jabbing a finger into my chest as she speaks
i know what she says
whitehot anger explodes out of me
without thinking i slap her across the face and shove her backwards advancing on her with the devils own wrath
tell me where shes gone i scream spittle flying out of my mouth
squeezing her bloody lips together mrs drudge glowers at me
my hands ball into fists
walk away
walk away now
summoning my will i turn my back on mrs drudge stalking up the suddenly silent passage
servants leap aside as i pass but my rage cant make sense of anything but itself
turning a corner i slump against a wall and let out a long breath
my hands are trembling the fog in my mind clearing
for those few terrifying seconds derby was utterly beyond my control
that was his poison spilling out of my mouth his bile coursing through my veins
i can feel it still
oil on my skin needles in my bones a yearning to do something dreadful
whatever happens today i need to keep tight hold of my temper or this creature is going to slip loose again and goodness knows what hell do
and thats the truly scary part
my hosts can fight back
23   mud sucks at my boots as i hurry into the gloom of the trees desperation tugging me along by a leash
after my failure to glean any information in the kitchen im striking out into the forest in hopes of stumbling upon evelyn along one of the marked trails
im counting on endeavour succeeding where calculation has failed
even if it doesnt i need to put some distance between derby and the temptations of blackheath
ive not gone far when the red flags bring me to a stream water surging around a large rock
a smashed wine bottle is halfencased in sludge beside a thick black overcoat bells silver compass having fallen out of the pocket
plucking it from the mud i turn it over in my palm just as i did that first morning my fingers tracing the initials sb engraved on the underside of the lid
sebastian bells initials
what a fool i felt when daniel pointed that out to me
half a dozen cigarette butts lie discarded on the ground suggesting bell stood here for a little while probably waiting for somebody
this must have been where he came after receiving the note at the dinner table though what could have driven him into the rain and cold at such an hour i cannot fathom
searching his discarded coat offers no clues his pockets turning up nothing but a lonely silver key probably to his trunk
wary of losing more time to my former host i drop the key and compass into my pocket and set out in search of the next red flag keeping my eyes open for any hint of the footman at my heels
this would be the perfect place for him to strike
god only knows how long i walk before i finally stumble upon the ruins of what must be charlie carvers old cottage
fire has hollowed it out consuming most of the roof leaving only the four blackened walls
debris crunches underfoot as i step inside startling some rabbits who flee into the woods their fur stained with wet ash
the skeletal remnants of an old bed are slumped in the corner a solitary table leg on the floor the detritus of a life interrupted
evelyn told me the cottage burst into flames the day the police hanged carver
more likely lord and lady hardcastle threw their memories onto the pyre and lit it themselves
who could blame them
carver stole their sons life by a lake
it seems only fitting they should rid themselves of him with fire
a rotten fence marks out the garden around the back of the cottage most of the slats having collapsed after years of neglect
great piles of purple and yellow flowers run wild in every direction red berries dangling from stems winding up the fence posts
a maid emerges from the trees as i kneel to tie my shoelace
such terror i hope never to see again
colour drains from her face her basket dropping on the floor spilling mushrooms in every direction
are you madeline i begin but shes already backing away looking around for help
im not here to hurt you im trying to  shes gone before i can utter another word bolting into the forest
snared by weeds i stagger after her half falling over the fence
picking myself up i catch sight of her through the trees glimpses of a black dress moving far more quickly than i would have reckoned
i call out but if anything my voice is the whip at her back driving her forward
even so im faster and stronger and though i dont wish to frighten the girl i cannot lose sight of her for fear of what will happen to evelyn
anna bell calls out from somewhere nearby
help me madeline screams back panicked and sobbing
shes so close now
i reach out hoping to tug her back but my fingers can only brush the material of her dress and offbalance i lose ground
she ducks to avoid a branch stumbling ever so slightly
i catch hold of her dress causing her to scream again before a shot whistles by my face cracking into a tree behind me
surprise loosens my grip on madeline who stumbles towards evelyn as she emerges from the forest
the black revolver she will take to the graveyard is in her hands but its not nearly as terrifying as the fury on her face
one wrong step and shell shoot me dead im certain of it
its not what
i can explain i pant hands on my knees
men like you always can says evelyn sweeping the terrified girl behind her with one arm
madelines sobbing her entire body shaking violently
god help me but derby enjoys this
hes aroused by the fear
hes done this before
all this please its a misunderstanding i gasp taking an imploring step forwards
stay back jonathan says evelyn fiercely gripping the revolver with both hands
stay away from this girl stay away from all of them  i didnt mean to  your mothers a friend of the family thats the only reason im letting you walk away interrupts evelyn
but if i see you near another woman if i even hear about it i swear ill put a bullet in you  taking care to keep the gun trained on me she removes her coat and wraps it around madelines heaving shoulders
youre going to stay by my side today she whispers to the terrified maid
ill see no harm comes to you  they stumble off through the trees leaving me alone in the forest
tipping my head to the sky i suck in cold air hoping the rain on my face will cool my frustration
i came here to prevent somebody attacking evelyn believing id unearth a murderer in the process
instead i caused the very thing i was trying to stop
im chasing my own tail terrifying an innocent woman in the process
maybe daniel was right maybe the future isnt a promise we can break
youre dawdling again says the plague doctor from behind me
hes standing on the far side of the clearing little more than a shadow
as always he seems to have picked the perfect position
far enough away that i cant possibly reach him but close enough that we can talk with relative ease
i thought i was helping i say bitterly still stung by what happened
you still can he says
sebastian bell is lost in the woods  of course
im not here for evelyn im here for bell
im here to make sure the loop begins again
fates leading me around by the nose
removing the compass from my pocket i hold it in the palm of my hand remembering the uncertainty i felt as i followed its quivering needle that first morning
without this bell will almost certainly remain lost
i toss it into the mud at the plague doctors feet
this is how i change things i say walking away
fetch him yourself  you misunderstand my purpose here he says the sharpness of his tone bringing me up short
if you leave sebastian bell to wander that forest alone hell never meet evelyn hardcastle hell never form the friendship you prize so highly
abandon him and you wont care about saving her  are you saying ill forget her i ask alarmed
im saying you should be careful which knots you unpick he says
if you abandon bell youll also be abandoning evelyn
it will be cruelty without purpose and nothing ive seen of you so far suggests youre a cruel man  perhaps i imagine it but for the first time theres a touch of warmth in his tone
its enough to unbalance me and i turn to face him once more
i need to see this day changed i say hearing the desperation in my voice
i need to see that it can be done  your frustration is understandable but what use is rearranging the furniture if you burn the house down doing it  bending over he retrieves the compass from the ground wiping the mud from its surface with his fingers
the way he groans and the heaviness of his limbs as he rises suggests an older man beneath the costume
satisfied with his work he tosses the compass to me the damn thing nearly slipping from my hands so wet is its surface
take this and solve evelyns murder  she committed suicide i watched her with my own eyes  if you think its that simple youre much further behind than i thought  and youre much crueller than i thought i growl
if you know whats happening here why not stop it
why play these games
hang the murderer before he harms her  an interesting idea except i dont know who the murderer is  how is that possible i say incredulously
you know every step im going to take before i think to take it
how could you be blind to the most important fact in this house  because its not my place to know
i watch you and you watch evelyn hardcastle
we both have our roles to play  then i could blame anybody for the crime i cry throwing my hands in the air
helena hardcastle did it
there you see
free me  you forget that i need proof
not merely your good word  and what if i save her what then  i dont think its possible and i think youll hamper your investigation trying but my offer stands regardless
evelyn was murdered last night and every night prior
even if you could save her tonight it doesnt change that
bring me the name of the person who kills or is planning to kill evelyn hardcastle and ill free you  for the second time since arriving in blackheath i find myself holding a compass and contemplating the instructions of somebody i cant trust
to do as the plague doctor asks is to give myself to a day determined to kill evelyn but there seems no way to change things without making them worse
assuming hes telling the truth i either save my first host or i abandon evelyn
you doubt my intentions he says prickling at my hesitation
of course i doubt your intentions i say
you wear a mask and you talk in riddles and i dont for a minute believe you brought me here just to solve a mystery
youre hiding something  and you think stripping me of my disguise will reveal it he scoffs
a face is a mask of another sort you know that better than most though youre right i am hiding something
if it makes you feel better im not hiding it from you
should you somehow succeed and tear this mask free id simply be replaced and your task would remain
ill let you decide if thats worth the trouble
as for your presence in blackheath perhaps it would assuage your doubts to know the name of the man who brought you here  and whats that  aiden bishop he says
unlike your rivals you came to blackheath voluntarily
everything thats happening today you brought upon yourself  his voice suggests regret but the expressionless white mask makes the statement sinister a parody of sadness
that cant be true i say stubbornly
why would i come here of my own free will
why would anybody do this to himself  your life before blackheath is none of my concern mr bishop
solve the murder of evelyn hardcastle and youll have all the answers you require he says
in the meantime bell needs your help he points behind me
hes that way  without another word he withdraws into the forest the dimness swallowing him completely
my mind is clogged up by a hundred small questions but none of them is going to do me any good in this forest so i push them to one side and go in search of bell finding him bent double and trembling with exertion
he freezes as i approach catching the sound of twigs cracking beneath my feet
his timidity revolts me
mistaken as she was at least madeline had the good sense to flee
i circle around behind my former self keeping my face from view
i could try to explain whats happening here but frightened rabbits make poor allies especially those already convinced youre a murderer
all i need from bell is his survival
two more steps and im behind him leaning close enough to whisper into his ear
sweat pours off his body the smell like a filthy rag pushed to my face
its all i can do to speak without gagging
east i say dropping the compass into his pocket
backing away i head into the trees towards carvers burntout cottage
bells going to be lost for another hour or so giving me plenty of time to follow the flags back to the house without stumbling into him
despite my best efforts everythings happening exactly as i remember it
24   the looming shape of blackheath appears through the gaps in the trees
ive come out around the back of the house which is in an even worse state of repair than the front
several windows are cracked the brickwork crumbling
a stone balustrade has tumbled from the roof to lodge itself in the grass thick moss covering it
clearly the hardcastles only repaired the sections of the house their guests would see – little wonder considering the paucity of their finances
just as i lingered on the edge of the forest that first morning i now find myself crossing the garden with similar foreboding
if i came here voluntarily i must have had a reason but no matter how hard i strain for the memory its beyond reach
id like to believe im a good man who came to help but if thats the case im making a damn mess of things
tonight as every night evelyns going to kill herself and if this mornings actions are any guide my attempts to paddle away from the disaster may only hurry us towards it
for all i know my fumbling attempts to save evelyn are actually the reason she ends up at that reflecting pool with a silver pistol in her hand
im so lost in these thoughts i dont notice millicent until im almost on top of her
the old lady is shivering on an iron bench that looks out across the garden her arms folded against the wind
three shapeless coats encase her completely her eyes peering out over a scarf pulled up above her mouth
shes blue with cold a hat pulled down over her ears
hearing my steps she turns to meet me surprise showing on her wrinkled face
by jove you look dreadful she says pulling the scarf down from her mouth
good morning to you too millicent i say taken aback by the sudden surge of warmth her presence stokes within me
millicent she says pursing her lips
thats rather modern of you dear
i prefer mother if its all the same to you
i wouldnt want people thinking i picked you up off the street
though sometimes i wonder if i mightnt have been better off  my mouth hangs open
i hadnt previously made the connection between jonathan derby and millicent derby probably because its easier to imagine him being delivered onto this earth by a biblical plague
sorry mother i say stuffing my hands into my pockets and sitting down beside her
she cocks an eyebrow at me those clever grey eyes alight with amusement
an apology and an appearance before midday are you feeling quite all right she asks
it must be the country air i say
what about you why are you out on this dreadful morning  she grunts hugging herself even tighter
im supposed to be meeting helena for a stroll but ive seen neither hide nor hair of the woman
no doubt shes got her times wrong as usual
i know shes meeting cecil ravenscourt this afternoon shes probably gone there instead  ravenscourts still asleep i say
millicent peers at me inquisitively
cunningham told me ravencourts valet i lie
you know him  vaguely  well i wouldnt get too friendly she tuts
i understand how much you enjoy dubious society but from what cecils told me this ones most unsuitable even by your low standards  that piques my interest
im fond of the valet but he only agreed to help me after i threatened to blackmail him with a secret hes keeping
until i know what hes hiding i cant depend on him and millicent might be the key to unearthing it
how so i ask casually
oh i dont know she says waving an airy hand at me
you know cecil secrets tucked between every fold of skin
if you believe the rumours he only hired cunningham because helena asked him to
now hes uncovered something unsavoury about the boy and is thinking of letting him go  unsavoury i say
well thats what cecil said not that i could get the rest out of him
blasted fellow has a bear trap for a mouth but you know how he hates scandal
given cunninghams parentage it must be desperately salacious if hes worried
wish i knew what it was  cunninghams parentage i ask
i think ive missed a step  the boy was raised at blackheath she says
cooks son or thats the story at least  its not true  the old lady cackles looking at me slyly
word has it the honourable lord peter hardcastle used to enjoy himself in london from time to time
well on one occasion his enjoyment followed him back to blackheath with a baby in her arms which she claimed was his
peter was ready to send the child to the church but helena stepped in and demanded they keep it  why would she do that  knowing helena she probably meant it as an insult sniffs millicent turning her face away from the bitter wind
she was never very fond of her husband and inviting his shame into the house would have tickled her
poor peter has probably cried himself to sleep every night for the last thirtythree years
either way they gave the baby to mrs drudge the cook to raise and helena made sure everybody knew whose child he was  does cunningham know any of this  cant see how he wouldnt its one of those secrets people shout at each other says the old lady plucking a handkerchief from her sleeve to wipe her running nose
anyway you can ask him yourself seeing as youre so chummy
shall we walk
i see little point in us freezing on this bench waiting for a woman who isnt coming  she stands before i have a chance to respond stamping her boots and blowing warm air into her gloved hands
it really is a dreadful day the grey sky spitting rain lathering itself into the fury of a storm
why are you even out here i ask our feet crunching along the gravel path that circles the house
couldnt you have met lady hardcastle inside  too many people id rather not bump into she says
why was she in the kitchen this morning
speaking of bumping into people i hear you were in the kitchen this morning i say
who told you that she bridles
well  i havent been anywhere near the kitchen she continues not waiting for a response
filthy places
the smell doesnt come out for weeks  she seems genuinely irritated by the suggestion which means she probably hasnt done it yet
a moment later she nudges me goodnaturedly her voice suddenly gleeful
did you hear about donald davies
apparently he took an automobile last night and ran off back to london
the stablemaster saw him said he turned up in the pouring rain dressed in every colour under the sun  that brings me pause
surely i should have returned to donald davies by now as i have done with the butler
he was my third host and anna told me im obliged to live one full day in each of them whether i want to or not
it cant have been much past midmorning when i left him asleep on the road so why havent i seen him again
you left him defenceless and alone
i felt a ripple of guilt
for all i know the footman has already found him
were you listening to me says millicent annoyed
i said donald davies took off in an automobile
theyre cracked that family every one of them and thats an official medical opinion  youve been talking to dickie i say absently still thinking about davies
been talked at more like she scoffs
thirty minutes i spent trying to keep my eyes off that moustache
im surprised sound can penetrate it  that makes me laugh
do you actually like anybody at blackheath mother  not that i recall but its envy i suspect
societys a dance darling and im too old to take part
speaking of dancing here comes the organ grinder himself  i follow her gaze to see daniel approaching us from the opposite direction
despite the cold hes dressed in a cricket sweater and linen trousers the same outfit hell be wearing when he encounters bell in the entrance hall for the first time
i check my watch that meeting cant be far off
mr coleridge calls out millicent with forced bonhomie
mrs derby he says drawing alongside us
broken any hearts this morning  they dont even quiver these days mr coleridge mores the pity theres something cautious in her tone as if shes crossing a bridge she feels certain will break
what disreputable business brings you out on such a terrible morning  ive a favour to ask your son and i assure you its entirely above board  well thats disappointing  for you and me both he looks at me for the first time
a minute derby  we step aside millicent doing her best to appear uninterested while shooting us speculative glances from above her scarf
whats wrong i ask
im going after the footman he says that handsome face of his caught somewhere between fear and excitement
how i say immediately taken with the idea
we know hes going to be in the dining hall tormenting ravencourt around one he says
i propose catching hold of the dog there  recalling those ghostly steps and that evil laughter is enough to raise goose bumps on my neck and the thought of finally laying hands on the devil sets fire to my veins
the ferocity of the feeling isnt far off what derby felt in the forest when we were chasing the maid and it immediately puts me on my guard
i cant give this host an inch
whats your scheme i say tempering my enthusiasm
i was in that room alone i couldnt even guess at where he was hiding  nor could i until i got talking to an old friend of the hardcastles at dinner last night he says drawing me a little further away from millicent whos managed to sidle near the edge of our conversation
turns out theres a warren of priest tunnels beneath the floorboards
thats where the footman was hiding and thats where well put an end to him  how  my new friend tells me there are entrances in the library drawing room and gallery
i suggest we each watch an entrance and grab him when he comes out  sounds ideal i say struggling to contain derbys rising excitement
ill take the library you take the drawing room
whos in the gallery  ask anna he says but none of us is strong enough to tackle the footman alone
why dont you two guard the library and ill round up some of our other hosts to help me with the drawing room and gallery  magnificent i say beaming
if i didnt have a hand on derbys lead hed already be running towards the tunnels with a lantern and a kitchen knife
good he says lavishing a smile of such affection upon me its impossible to imagine how we could ever fail
take your position a few minutes before one
with any luck this will all be over by dinner  he turns to depart but i catch his arm
did you tell anna youd find a way for both of us to escape if she helped us i ask
he gazes at me steadily and i quickly withdraw my hand
yes he says
its a lie isnt it i say
only one of us can escape blackheath  lets call it a potential lie shall we
ive not given up hope of fulfilling our end of the bargain  youre my last host how much hope do you have  not a great deal he says his expression softening
i know youre fond of her
believe me i havent forgotten how that felt but we need her on our side
we wont escape this house if we have to spend the day looking over our shoulder for both the footman and anna  i have to tell her the truth i say aghast at his callous disregard of my friend
he stiffens
do that and you make an enemy of her he hisses looking around to make sure were not being overheard
at which point any hope of genuinely helping her goes up in smoke  puffing out his cheeks he ruffles his hair and smiles at me agitation leaking out of him like air from a punctured balloon
do what you think is right he says
but at least wait until weve caught the footman he checks his watch
three more hours thats all im asking  our eyes meet mine doubtful and his appealing
i cant help but submit
very well i say
you wont regret it he says
squeezing my shoulder he waves cheerily at millicent before striding back towards blackheath a man possessed by purpose
i turn to find millicent contemplating me through pursed lips
you have some rotten friends she says
im a rotten sort of chap i respond holding her gaze until finally she shakes her head and carries on walking slowing enough for me to fall in step beside her
we come upon a long greenhouse
most of the windowpanes are cracked the plants inside so overgrown theyre bulging against the glass
millicent peers inside but the foliage is much too dense
she gestures for me to follow and we head to the far end finding the doors locked with a new chain and padlock
pity she says rattling it futilely
i used to love coming here when i was younger  youve visited blackheath before  i summered here when i was girl we all did cecil ravencourt the curtis twins peter hardcastle and helena – thats how they met
when i married i brought your brother and sister down
they practically grew up with evelyn michael and thomas  she links my arm continuing our walk
oh i used to love those summers she says
helena was always frightfully jealous of your sister because evelyn was so plain
michael wasnt much better mind with that squashed face of his
thomas was the only one with a dash of beauty and he ended up in that lake which strikes me as fate kicking the poor woman twice but there it is
wasnt a one of them could measure up to you my handsome lad she says cupping my cheek
evelyn turned out all right i protest
shes quite striking actually  really says millicent disbelievingly
must have blossomed in paris not that id know
the girls been avoiding me all morning
like mother like daughter i suppose
explains why cecils circling though
vainest man ive ever met which is saying something after fifty years of living with your father  the hardcastles hate her you know
evelyn i mean  whos filled your head with that rot says millicent gripping my arm while she shakes her foot trying to dislodge some mud from her boot
michael adores her
hes over in paris almost every month and from what i understand theyve been thick as thieves since she got back
and peter doesnt hate her hes indifferent
its only helena and shes never been quite right since thomas died
still comes up here you know
every year on the anniversary of his death she takes a walk around the lake even talks to him sometimes
heard her myself  the path has brought us to the reflecting pool
this is where evelyn will take her life tonight and as with everything at blackheath its beauty is dependent on distance
viewed from the ballroom the reflecting pools a magnificent sight a long mirror conveying all the drama of the house
here and now though its just a filthy pond the stone cracked moss growing thick as carpet on the surface
why take her life here
why not in her bedroom or the entrance hall
are you okay dear asks millicent
you look a little pale  i was thinking its a shame theyve let the place go i say hoisting a smile onto my face
oh i know but what could they do she says adjusting her scarf
after the murder they couldnt live here and nobody wants these big piles any more especially not when they have blackheaths history
should have left it to the forest if you ask me  its a maudlin thought but nothing lingers in jonathan derbys mind for too long and im soon distracted by the preparations for tonights party which i can see through the ballroom windows beside us
servants and workmen are scrubbing the floors and painting the walls while maids balance on teetering stepladders with long feather dusters
at the far end of the hall boredlooking musicians are scraping semiquavers off the surface of their polished instruments as evelyn hardcastle points and gesticulates arranging things from the centre of the room
shes flitting from group to group touching arms and spreading kindness making me ache for that afternoon we spent together
i search for madeline aubert finding her laughing with lucy harper – the maid abused by stanwin and befriended by ravencourt – the two of them arranging a chaise longue by the stage
that these two mistreated women have found each other brings me a small measure of comfort though it by no means alleviates my guilt over this mornings events
i told you last time i wouldnt clean up another of your indiscretions says millicent sharply her entire body stiff
shes watching me watching the maids
loathing and love swirl within her eyes the shape of derbys secrets visible in the fog
what id only vaguely understood before now stands in stark relief
derbys a rapist more than once over
theyre all there held in millicents gaze every woman hes attacked every life hes destroyed
she carries them all
whatever darkness lurks inside jonathan derby millicent tucked it in at night
its always the weak ones with you isnt it she says
always the  she falls silent her mouth hanging open as though the next words simply evaporated on her lips
i have to go she says suddenly squeezing my hand
ive had a very strange thought
ill see you at dinner darling  without another word millicent turns back the way we came disappearing around the corner of the house
perplexed i look back into the ballroom trying to see what she saw but everybodys moved around except for the band
thats when i notice the chess piece on the window ledge
if im not mistaken its the same handcarved piece i found in bells trunk speckled with white paint and looking at me through clumsily whittled eyes
theres a message etched into the dirt on the glass above it
behind you
sure enough annas waving at me from the edge of the forest her tiny body shrouded by a grey coat
pocketing the chess piece i glance left and right to make sure were alone and then follow her deeper into the trees beyond blackheaths sight
she looks to have been waiting for some time and is dancing from foot to foot to keep warm
judging by her blue cheeks its not doing the blindest bit of good
little wonder given her attire
shes draped in shades of grey her coat threadbare her knitted hat thin as gossamer
these are clothes passed down and down and down patched so many times the original material is long gone
dont suppose youve got an apple or something she says without preamble
im bloody starving  ive got a hip flask i say holding it out to her
have to do i suppose she says taking it from me and unscrewing the cap
i thought it was too dangerous for us to meet outside of the gatehouse  who told you that she asks wincing as she tastes the flasks contents
you did i say
will  what  i will tell you it isnt safe for us to meet but i havent yet she says
i couldnt have ive only been awake a few hours and ive spent most of that time keeping the footman from making pincushions out of your future hosts
missed breakfast doing it too  i blink at her struggling to stitch together a day being delivered in the wrong order
not for the first time i find myself wishing for the speed of ravencourts mind
working within the confines of jonathan derbys intellect is like stirring croutons into a thick soup
seeing my confusion she frowns
do you know about the footman yet
i never know where were up to  i very quickly tell her about bells dead rabbit and the ghostly steps that dogged ravencourt in the dining hall her expression darkening with each fresh detail
that bastard she splutters when im finished
shes prowling back and forth her hands clenched and shoulders rolled forwards
wait until i get my hands on him she says shooting the house a murderous glance
you wont have to wait long i say
daniel thinks hes hiding in some tunnels
theres a few entrances but were going to guard the library
he wants us in there before one  or we could slit our own throats and save the footman the bother of killing us she says her tone frank and unimpressed
shes looking at me as if ive lost my mind
whats wrong  the footmans not an idiot she says
if we know where he is its because were supposed to know
hes been one step ahead of us since this started
wouldnt surprise me one bit if hes lying in wait hoping to trip us up on our own cleverness  we have to do something i protest
we will but whats the point of doing something stupid when we can do something smart she says patiently
listen to me aiden i know youre desperate but weve got a deal you and me
i keep you alive so you can find evelyns killer and then we both get out of here
this is me doing my job
now promise me you wont go after the footman  her argument makes sense but its weightless against my fear
if theres a chance to put an end to this madman before he finds me im going to take it no matter the risk
id rather die on my feet than cowering in a corner
i promise i say adding another lie to the pile
thankfully annas too cold to notice the catch in my voice
despite having drunk from the hip flask shes shivering so hard all the colour has abandoned her face
in an attempt to shelter from the wind she presses against me
i can smell the soap on her skin forcing me to avert my gaze
i dont want her to see derbys lust squirming within me
sensing my discomfort she tilts her head to meet my downcast face
your other hosts are better i promise she says
you have to keep hold of yourself
dont give in to him  how do i do that when i dont know where they start and i begin  if you werent here derby would have his hands all over me she says
thats how you know who you are
you dont just remember it you do it and you keep doing it  even so she takes a step back into the wind freeing me from my discomfort
you shouldnt be out in this weather i say removing my scarf and wrapping it around her neck
youll catch your death  and if you keep this up people might begin mistaking jonathan derby for a human being she says tucking the loose ends of the scarf into her coat
tell evelyn hardcastle that i say
she nearly shot me this morning  you should have shot her back says anna matteroffactly
we could have solved her murder then and there  i cant tell if youre joking or not i say
of course i am she says blowing into her chapped hands
if it were that simple wed have been out of here ages ago
mind you im not sure trying to save her life is a much better plan  you think i should let her die  i think were spending a lot of time not doing the thing weve been asked to do  we cant protect evelyn without knowing who wants her dead i say
one thing will give us the other  i hope youre right she says dubiously
i search for some encouraging platitude but her doubts have crawled under my skin and theyre beginning to itch
i told her that saving evelyns life would deliver us the murderer but that was an evasion
theres no plan here
i dont even know if i can save evelyn any more
im working at the behest of blind sentiment and losing ground to the footman as im doing it
anna deserves better but i have no idea how to give it to her without abandoning evelyn – and for some reason the thought of doing that is unbearable to me
theres a commotion on the path voices carried through the trees by the wind
taking my arm anna pulls me further into the forest
as fun as this has been i came to ask for a favour  always what can i do  whats the time she says pulling the artists sketchbook from her pocket
its the same one i saw her holding in the gatehouse crumpled sheets and a cover riddled with holes
shes holding it up so i cant see inside but judging by the way shes flicking through the pages it says something important
i check my watch
its 1008 am i say itching with curiosity
whats in the book  notes information everything ive managed to learn about your eight hosts and what theyre doing she says absently running her finger down one of the pages
and dont ask to see it because you cant
we cant risk you pulling the day down around our ears with what you know  i wasnt going to i protest hastily averting my eyes
right 1008 am
perfect
in a minute im going to put a rock on the grass
i need you standing by it when evelyn kills herself
you cant move aiden not an inch understand  whats the meaning of all this anna  call it plan b she pecks me on the cheek cold lips meeting numb flesh as she slides the book back in her pocket
shes only taken a step when she clicks her fingers and turns back to me holding out two white tablets in her palm
take these for later she says
i filched them from doctor dickies bag when he came to see the butler  what are they  headache pills ill trade them for my chess piece  this ugly old thing i say handing her the handcarved bishop
why would you want it  she smiles at me watching as i wrap the tablets in a blue pocket handkerchief
because you gave it to me she says clutching it protectively in her hand
it was the first promise you made me
this ugly old thing is the reason i stopped being scared of this place
its the reason i stopped being scared of you  me
why would you be afraid of me i say genuinely hurt by the idea of anything coming between us
oh aiden she says shaking her head
if we do this right everybody in this house is going to be afraid of you  shes carried away on those words blown through the trees and out onto the grass surrounding the reflecting pool
perhaps its her youth or her personality or some curious alchemy of all the miserable ingredients surrounding us but i cant see an ounce of doubt within her
whatever her plan she seems extraordinarily confident in it
maybe dangerously so
from my position in the treeline i watch her pick up a large white rock from the flower bed and pace out six steps before dropping it on the grass
holding an arm straight out from her body she measures a line to the ballrooms french doors and then seemingly satisfied with her work she wipes the mud from her hands shoves them in her pockets and strolls away
for some reason this little display makes me uneasy
i came here voluntarily and anna did not
the plague doctor brought her to blackheath for a reason and i have no idea what that could be
whoever anna really is im following her blindly
25   the bedroom doors locked no noise coming from inside
id hoped to catch helena hardcastle before she set about her day but it appears the lady of the house is not one to idle
i rattle the handle again pressing my ear to the wood
aside from a few curious glances from passing guests my efforts are in vain
shes not here
im walking away when the thought hits me the room hasnt been broken into yet
ravencourt will find the door shattered early this afternoon so its going to happen in the next few hours
im curious to see whos responsible and why theyre so desperate to get inside
id originally suspected evelyn because she had one of the two revolvers stolen from helenas bureau but she nearly killed me with it in the forest this morning
if its already in her possession she has no need to break in
unless theres something else she wants
the only other thing that was obviously missing was the appointments page in helenas dayplanner
millicent believed helena tore it out herself to conceal some suspicious deed but cunninghams fingerprints were all over the remaining pages
he refused to explain himself and denied being responsible for the breakin but if i could catch him with his shoulder to the door hed have no choice but to come clean
my mind made up i stride into the shadows at the far end of the corridor and begin my vigil
five minutes later derby is already impossibly bored
im fidgeting stalking back and forth
i cant calm him
at a loss i follow the smell of breakfast towards the drawing room planning to carry a plate of food and a chair back to the corridor
hopefully theyll placate my host for half an hour after which time ill have to come up with some new amusement
i find the room smothered in sleepy conversation
most of the guests are only halfway out of their beds and they reek of the prior evening sweat and cigar smoke baked into their skin spirits curled around every breath
theyre talking quietly and moving slowly porcelain people riddled with cracks
taking a plate from the sideboard i scoop piles of eggs and kidneys onto a large plate pausing to eat a sausage from the platter and wipe the grease from my lips with my sleeve
im so preoccupied it takes a little while to realise everybodys gone silent
a burly fellow is standing at the door his gaze passing from face to face relief coursing through those he slips over
this nervousness is not unwarranted
hes a brutishlooking chap with a ginger beard and sagging cheeks his nose so mangled it resembles an egg cracked in a frying pan
an old frayed suit strains to contain his width raindrops sparkling on shoulders you could serve a buffet on
his gaze lands on me like a boulder in the lap
mr stanwin wants to see you he says
his voice is coarse filled with jagged consonants
what for i ask
i expect hell tell you  well offer my regrets to mr stanwin but im afraid im very busy at present  either you walk or i carry you he says in a low rumble
derbys temper is bubbling nicely but theres no use making a scene
i cant beat this man the best i can hope for is to quickly meet stanwin and return to my task
besides im curious why hed want to see me
placing my plate of food on the sideboard i rise to follow stanwins thug from the room
inviting me to walk ahead of him the burly fellow guides me up the staircase telling me to turn right at the top into the closedoff east wing
brushing aside the curtain a damp breeze touches my face a long corridor stretching out before me
doors are hanging off their hinges revealing state rooms covered in dust and fourposter beds collapsed in on themselves
the air scratches my throat as i breathe it
why dont you wait in that room over there like a good gentleman and ill tell mr stanwin youve arrived says my escort jerking his chin towards a room on my left
doing as he bids i enter a nursery the cheerful yellow wallpaper now hanging limp from the walls
games and wooden toys litter the floor a weathered rocking horse put out to pasture by the door
theres a game in progress on a childs chessboard the white pieces decimated by the black
no sooner have i set foot inside than i hear evelyn shrieking in the room beside me
for the first time derby and i move in concert sprinting around the corner to find the door blocked by the redheaded thug
mr stanwins still busy chum he says rocking back and forth to keep warm
im looking for evelyn hardcastle i heard her scream i say breathlessly
mayhap you did but doesnt seem like theres much you can do about it does there  i peer over his shoulder into the room behind hoping to catch sight of evelyn
it looks to be some sort of reception area but its empty
the furniture lies under yellowed sheets black mould growing up from the hems
the windows are covered in old newspaper the walls little more than rotting boards
theres another door on the far wall but its closed
they must be in there
i return my gaze to the man who smiles at me exposing a row of crooked yellow teeth
anything else he says
i need to make sure shes all right  i try to barge past him but its a foolish notion
hes three times my weight and half again my height
more to the point he knows how to use his strength
planting a flat hand on my stomach he shoves me backwards barely a flicker of emotion on his face
dont bother he says
im paid to stand here and make sure nice gentlemen like you dont do themselves a misfortune by wandering places they aint supposed to go  theyre just words coals in the furnace
my bloods boiling
i try to dart around him and like a fool i think ive succeeded until im hoisted backwards and tossed bodily back down the corridor
i scramble to my feet snarling
he hasnt moved
he isnt out of breath
he doesnt care
your parents gave you everything but sense didnt they he says the blandness of the sentiment hitting me like a bucketful of cold water
mr stanwins not hurting her if thats your concern
wait a few minutes and you can ask her all about it when she comes out  we eye each other for a moment before i retreat along the corridor into the nursery
hes right im not getting by him but i cant wait for evelyn to come out
she wont tell jonathan derby anything after this morning and whatever is happening behind that door could be the reason she takes her life tonight
hurrying over to the wall i press my ear to the boards
if i havent missed my mark evelyns talking to stanwin in the room next door only a few pieces of rotten wood between us
i soon catch the hum of their voices much too faint to make anything out
using my pocket knife i tear the wallpaper from the wall digging the blade between the loose wooden slats to pry them free
theyre so damp they come away without objection the wood disintegrating in my hands
 tell her she best not play any games with me or itll be the end of both of you says stanwin his voice poking through the insulating wall
tell her yourself im not your errand girl says evelyn coldly
youll be anything i damn well please so long as im footing the bill  i dont like your tone mr stanwin says evelyn
and i dont like being made a fool of miss hardcastle he says practically spitting her name
you forget i worked here for nearly fifteen years
i know every corner of this place and everybody in it
dont mistake me for one of these blinkered bastards youve surrounded yourself with  his hatred is viscous it has texture
i could wring it out of the air and bottle it
what about the letter says evelyn quietly her outrage overwhelmed
ill keep hold of that so you understand our arrangement  youre a vile creature are you aware of that  stanwin swats the insult from the air with a belly laugh
at least im an honest one he says
how many other people in this house can claim the same thing
you can go now
dont forget to pass along my message  i hear the door to stanwins room open evelyn storming past the nursery a few moments later
im tempted to follow her but thered be little value in another confrontation
besides evelyn mentioned something about a letter thats now in stanwins possession
she seemed keen to retrieve it which means i need to see it
who knows perhaps stanwin and derby are friends
jonathan derbys waiting for you in the nursery i hear the burly fellow tell stanwin
good says stanwin drawers scraping open
let me get changed for this hunt and well go and have a word with the greasy little bugger  or perhaps not
26   i sit with my feet on the table the chessboard beside them
cupping my chin in my hand i stare at the game trying to decipher some strategy from the arrangement of the pieces
its proving an impossible task
derbys too flighty for study
his attention is forever straying towards the window towards the dust in the air and the noises in the corridor
hes never at peace
daniel warned me that each of our hosts thinks differently but only now do i comprehend the full extent of his meaning
bell was a coward and ravencourt ruthless but both possessed focused minds
thats not the case with derby
thoughts come buzzing through his head like bluebottles lingering long enough to be distracting but never settling
a sound draws my attention to the door ted stanwin shaking out a match as he surveys me from above his pipe
hes larger than i recall a slab of a man spreading sideways like a wedge of melting butter
never took you for a chess man jonathan he says pushing the old rocking horse back and forth so that it thumps on the floor
im teaching myself i say
good for you men should seek to better themselves  his eyes linger on me before being tugged to the windows
though stanwin hasnt done or said anything threatening derbys afraid of him
my pulse is tapping that out in morse code
i glance at the door ready to bolt but the burly fellow is leaning against the wall in the corridor with his arms crossed
he offers me a little nod friendly as two men in a cell
your mothers running a little late on her payments says stanwin his forehead pressed against the window
i hope alls well  quite well i say
id hate for that to change  i shift in my seat to catch his eye
are you threatening me mr stanwin  he turns from the window smiling at the fellow in the corridor then myself
of course not jonathan im threatening your mother
you dont think id come all this way for a worthless little sod like yourself do you  taking a puff on his pipe he picks up a doll and casually tosses it at the chessboard sending the pieces scattering across the room
rage snatches me up by the strings flinging me at him but he catches my fist in the air spinning me around as one of his huge arms crushes my throat
his breath is on my neck rotten as old meat
talk to your mother jonathan he sneers squeezing my windpipe hard enough for black spots to swim in the corners of my eyes
otherwise i might have to pay her a visit  he lets the words settle then releases me
i drop to my knees clutching my throat and gasping for air
youll come a cropper with that temper he says jabbing his pipe in my direction
id get it under control if i were you
dont worry my friend here is good at helping people learn new things  i glare at him from the floor but hes already on his way out
passing into the corridor he nods to his companion who steps into the room
he looks at me without emotion peeling off his jacket
on your feet lad he says
sooner we get started sooner itll be over  somehow he seems even bigger than he did at the door
his chest is a shield his arms straining the seams of his white shirt
terror takes hold of me as he closes the distance between us my fingers searching blindly for a weapon and finding the heavy chessboard on the table
without thinking i hurl it at him
time seems to hang as the chessboard turns in the air an impossible object in flight my future clinging onto its surface for dear life
evidently fate has a soft spot for me because it hits his face with a sickening crunch sending him reeling backwards into the wall with a muffled cry
im on my feet as the blood pours between his fingers sprinting down the corridor with stanwins angry voice at my back
a quick glance behind me reveals stanwins halfway out of the reception room his face red with rage
fleeing down the staircase i follow the burble of voices into the drawing room which is now full of redeyed guests digging into their breakfasts
doctor dickies guffawing with michael hardcastle and clifford herrington the naval officer i met at dinner while cunningham piles food onto the silver platter that will greet ravencourt when he wakes up
a sudden quieting of chatter tells me stanwins approaching and i slip through into the study hiding behind the door
im half hysterical my heart beating hard enough to shatter my ribs
i want to laugh and cry to pick up a weapon and throw myself at stanwin screaming
its taking all my concentration to stand still but if i dont im going to lose this host and one more precious day
peering through the gap between the door and frame i watch as stanwin wrenches people around by the shoulder searching for my face
men stand aside for him the powerful mumbling vague apologies as he approaches
whatever his hold on these people its complete enough that nobody takes umbrage at his manhandling of them
he could beat me to death in the middle of the carpet and they wouldnt say a word about it
ill find no help here
something cold touches my fingers and looking down i discover my hand has closed around a heavy cigarette box on a shelf
derbys arming himself
hissing at him i let it go and return my attention to the drawing room almost crying out in shock
stanwins a few paces away and hes walking directly towards the study
i look for places to hide but there arent any and i cant flee into the library without passing the door hes about to walk through
im trapped
picking up the cigarette box i take a deep breath preparing to pounce on him when he walks in
nobody appears
slipping back to the gap i peek into the drawing room
hes nowhere to be seen
im shaking uncertain
derby isnt built for indecision he doesnt have the patience and before i know it im creeping around the door to get a better view
i immediately see stanwin
he has his back to me and is talking to doctor dickie
im too far away to catch their conversation but its enough to propel the good doctor out of the room presumably to tend to stanwins stricken bodyguard
he has sedatives
the idea delivers itself fully formed
i just need to get out of here without being seen
a voice calls to stanwin from near the table and the moment hes out of sight i drop the cigarette case and flee into the gallery taking the long way around to reach the entrance hall unseen
i catch doctor dickie as hes leaving his bedroom his medical case swinging in his hand
he smiles as he sees me that ridiculous moustache of his leaping about two inches up his face
ah young master jonathan he says cheerfully as i fall into step beside him
everything well
you seem a little puffed  im fine i say hurrying to keep up with him
well im not actually
i need a favour  his eyes narrow the cheerful tone dropping out of his voice
what have you done this time  the man youre going to see i need you to sedate him  sedate him
why the devil would i sedate him  because hes going to harm my mother  millicent he stops dead grabbing me by the arm with a surprising amount of strength
whats all this about jonathan  she owes stanwin money  his face falls his grip loosening
without his joviality inflating him he seems a tired old thing the lines on his face a little deeper the sorrows less obscure
for a moment i feel a little guilty about what im doing to him but then i remember the look in his eyes when he sedated the butler and all my doubts are wiped away
so he has dear millicent under his thumb does he he says sighing
shouldnt be surprised i suppose the fiends got something on the lot of us
still i thought  he carries on walking though slower than before
were at the top of the staircase leading down to the entrance hall which is flooded with cold
the front door is open a group of old men departing for a walk taking their laughter with them
i cant see stanwin anywhere
so this fellow threatened your mother and you attacked him eh says dickie evidently having made up his mind
he beams at me clapping me on the back
i see theres some of your father in you after all
but how will sedating this ruffian help  i need a chance to talk with mother before he gets to her  for all derbys faults hes an accomplished liar the deceits queuing in orderly fashion on his tongue
doctor dickies silent rolling the story around his head kneading it into shape as we cross into the abandoned east wing
ive got just the thing should put the blighter out for the rest of the afternoon he says clicking his fingers
you wait here ill signal when its done  squaring his shoulders and puffing out his chest he strides towards stanwins bedroom the old soldier given one last battle to fight
its too exposed in the corridor and once dickies out of sight i step through the nearest door my reflection staring back at me from a cracked mirror
yesterday i couldnt have imagined anything worse than being stuck inside ravencourt but derbys an entirely different torment – a restless malevolent imp scurrying between tragedies of his own devising
i cant wait to be free of him
ten minutes later the floorboards creak outside
jonathan whispers doctor dickie
jonathan where are you  here i say poking my head outside
hes already passed the room and jumps at the sound of my voice
gently young man the old ticker you know he says tapping his chest
cerberus is asleep and will be for most of the day
now im going to deliver my prognosis to mr stanwin
i suggest you use this time to hide yourself somewhere he wont find you
argentina perhaps
good luck to you  he stands to attention offering me a sharp salute
i throw one back at him earning a pat on the shoulder before he saunters off down the corridor whistling tunelessly
i rather suspect ive made his day but i have no intention of hiding
stanwin is going to be distracted by dickie for a few minutes at least giving me a chance to search his belongings for evelyns letter
crossing the reception room previously guarded by stanwins bodyguard i open the door into the blackmailers bedroom
its a desolate place the floorboards barely covered by a threadbare rug a single iron bed pushed against the wall flakes of white paint clinging stubbornly to the rust
the only comforts are a starving fire spitting ash and a small bedside table with two dogeared books on it
as promised stanwins man is asleep on the bed looking for all the world like a monstrous marionette with all of its strings cut
his face is bandaged and hes snoring loudly his fingers twitching
i can only imagine hes dreaming of my neck
keeping an ear out for stanwins return i quickly open the cupboard sifting through the pockets of his jackets and trousers finding only lint and mothballs
his trunk is equally bereft of personal objects the man seemingly immune to sentiment of any kind
frustrated i check my watch
ive already been here longer than is safe but derbys not easily deterred
my host knows deceit
he knows men like stanwin and the secrets they keep
the blackmailer could have had the most luxurious room in the house if hed wanted but he chose to sequester himself in a ruin
hes paranoid and clever
whatever his secrets he wouldnt carry them with him not when hes surrounded by enemies
theyre here
hidden and under guard
my gaze falls on the fireplace and its anaemic flames
odd considering how cold the bedroom is
kneeling down i stick my hand up the flume feeling around and finding a small shelf my groping fingers closing on a book
withdrawing it i see that its a small black journal its cover bearing the scars of a lifetimes abuse
stanwin was keeping the fire low to avoid scorching his prize
flicking through the tattered pages i discover its a ledger of sorts containing a list of dates going back nineteen years alongside entries written in strange symbols
it must be some sort of code
evelyns letter is stuffed between the last two pages
dearest evelyn  mr stanwin has informed me of your plight and i can quite understand your concern
your mothers behaviour is certainly alarming and youre quite right to be on guard against whatever scheme shes cooking up
i stand ready to help but im afraid mr stanwins word will not be enough
i require some proof of your agency in these matters
in the society pages ive often seen you wearing a signet ring a small castle engraved on its surface
send me this and ill know of your serious intent
warmest regards  felicity maddox  looks like clever old evelyn didnt accept her fate as easily as i first believed
she brought in somebody called felicity maddox to help and the description of the small castle recalls the one drawn on the note at the well
it may be serving as a signature which suggests the message to stay away from millicent derby was from felicity
the bodyguard snores
unable to wring any further information from the letter i replace it in the ledger and slip both in my pocket
thank heavens for devious minds i mutter stepping through the door
you said it says somebody behind me
pain explodes in my head as i slam into the floor
27   day two continued  im coughing blood red drops spattering my pillow
im back in the butler my aching body screaming as my head jerks upwards
the plague doctors sitting in annas chair one leg thrown across the other his top hat in his lap
hes drumming it with his fingers coming to a stop when he notices me stirring
welcome back mr bishop he says his voice muffled by the mask
i stare at him absently my coughing subsiding as i begin to piece together the pattern of this day
the first time i found myself in this body it was morning
i answered the door to bell and was attacked by gold after running up the stairs for answers
the second time wasnt more than fifteen minutes later
i was transported to the gatehouse in the carriage with anna
must have been midday when i woke up and we were properly introduced but judging by the light outside the window its now early afternoon
it makes sense
anna told me we get a full day in each of our hosts but it never occurred to me that id experience one in so many fragments
it feels like a perverse joke
i was promised eight hosts to solve this mystery and ive been given them except that bell was a coward the butler was beaten half to death donald davies fled ravencourt could barely move and derby cant hold a thought
its like ive been asked to dig a hole with a shovel made of sparrows
shifting in his seat the plague doctor leans closer to me
his clothes are musty that old attic smell of something long forgotten and badly aired
our last conversation was rather abrupt he says
so i thought you might report on your progress
have you discovered  why did it have to be this body i interrupt wincing as a hot streak of pain shoots up through my side
why trap me in any of these bodies
ravencourt couldnt walk two steps without tiring the butlers incapacitated and derbys a monster
if you really want me to escape blackheath why stack the deck against me
there must be better alternatives  more able perhaps but these men all have some connection to evelyns murder he says
making them best placed to help you solve it  theyre suspects  witnesses would be a more apt description  a yawn shakes me my energy already evaporating
doctor dickie must have given me another sedative
i feel as though im being squeezed out of this body through the feet
and who decides the order i say
why did i wake up as bell first and derby today
is there any way for me to predict who ill be next  leaning back he steeples his fingers and cocks his head
its a lengthy silence revaluating and readjusting
whether hes pleased by what he finds or annoyed i cant tell
why are you asking these questions he says eventually
curiosity i say and when he doesnt respond to that and im hoping theres some advantage to be found in the answers i add
he makes a small grunt of approval
good to see youre finally taking this seriously he says
very well
under normal circumstances youd arrive in your hosts in the order they woke throughout the day
fortunately for you ive been tampering  tampering  weve done this dance many times before you and i more than even i can recall
loop after loop ive set you the task of solving evelyn hardcastles murder and its always ended in failure
at first i thought the blame for this rested solely on your shoulders but ive come to realise that the sequence of hosts plays a part
for example donald davies wakes up at 319 am which should make him your first host
that doesnt work because his life is so appealing
he has good friends in the house family
things you spend the loop trying to return to rather than seeking to escape
its for that reason i changed your first host to the more rootless sebastian bell he says hoisting his trouser leg to scratch his ankle
in contrast lord ravencourt doesnt stir until 1030 am which meant you shouldnt have visited him until much deeper in the loop a period when haste rather than intellect is of the essence  i can hear the pride in his voice the sense of a watchmaker standing back and admiring the mechanism hes built
each new loop i experimented making these sorts of decisions for each of your hosts arriving at the order youre experiencing now he says spreading his hands magnanimously
in my opinion this is the sequence that gives you the best chance of solving the mystery  so why havent i returned to donald davies the way i keep returning to the butler  because you walked him down that endless road to the village for almost eight hours and hes exhausted says the plague doctor a hint of rebuke in his tone
hes currently sleeping deeply and will be until – he checks his watch – 938 pm until then youll continue to be tugged between the butler and your other hosts  wood creaks in the corridor
i consider calling for anna a thought which must show on my face because the plague doctor tuts at me
come now how clumsy do you think i am he says
anna left a little while ago to meet with lord ravencourt
believe me i know the routines of this house as a director knows those of the actors in his play
if i had any doubt that we might be interrupted i wouldnt be here  i have the sense of being a nuisance to him an errant child in the headmasters office again
barely worth a scolding
a yawn rattles me long and loud
my brain is clouding over
we have a few more minutes to talk before you fall asleep again says the plague doctor clasping his gloved hands together the leather squeaking
if youve any more questions for me now would be the time  why is anna in blackheath i say quickly
you said i chose to come here and my rivals didnt
that means she was brought here against her will
why are you doing this to her  any questions aside from that one he says
walking into blackheath voluntarily brings certain advantages
there are also disadvantages things your rivals instinctively understand which you do not
im here to fill in those blanks nothing more
now how goes the investigation into evelyn hardcastles murder  shes one girl i say wearily struggling to keep my eyes open
the drugs are tugging at me with their warm hands
what makes her death worth all of this  i could ask you the same question he says
youre going out of your way to save miss hardcastle despite all the evidence suggesting its impossible
why is that  i cant watch her die and do nothing to prevent it i say
thats very noble of you he says cocking his head
then let me respond in kind
miss hardcastles murder was never solved and i dont believe such a thing should be allowed to stand
does that satisfy you  people are murdered every day i say
righting one wrong cant be the only reason for all of this  an excellent point he says clapping his hands together in appreciation
but whos to say there arent hundreds of others like yourself seeking justice for those souls  are there  doubtful but its a lovely thought isnt it  im conscious of the effort of listening the weight of my eyelids the way the room is melting around me
we dont have much time im afraid says the plague doctor
i should  wait
i need to why did my words are sludge thick in my mouth
you asked me you asked my memory  theres a great rustling of material as the plague doctor gets to his feet
picking up a glass of water from the sideboard he hurls the contents in my face
the waters freezing cold my body convulses like a cracked whip dragging me back to myself
apologies that was most irregular he says staring at the empty glass clearly surprised at his actions
normally i let you fall asleep at this point but well im intrigued he puts the glass down slowly
what did you want to ask me
please choose your words carefully theyre of some import  water stings my eyes and drips off my lips the wetness spreading through my cotton nightshirt
when we first met you asked me what i remembered when i woke up as bell i say
why would that matter  each time you fail we strip your memories and start the loop again but you always find a way to hold onto something important a clue if you will he says dabbing the water from my forehead with a handkerchief
this time it was annas name  you told me it was a pity i say
it is  why  along with the sequence of your hosts the thing you choose to remember usually has a significant impact on how the loop plays out he says
if you had remembered the footman youd have set off chasing him
at least that would have been useful
instead youve bound yourself to anna one of your rivals  shes my friend i say
nobody has friends in blackheath mr bishop and if you havent learned that yet im afraid there may be no hope for you  can the sedative is dragging at me once again
can we both escape  no he says folding his damp handkerchief and replacing it in his pocket
an answer for an exit thats how this works
at 11 pm one of you will come to the lake and give me the murderers name and that person will be allowed to leave
youre going to have to choose who that is  he lifts his gold watch from his breast pocket to check the time
time runs away and i have a schedule to keep he says retrieving his cane from its spot by the door
normally i remain impartial in these matters but theres something you should know before you trip over your nobility
anna remembers more from the last loop than shes telling you  his gloved hand lifts my chin his face so close to mine i can hear his breathing through the mask
he has blue eyes
old sad blue eyes
shes going to betray you  i open my mouth to protest but my tongues too heavy to move and the last thing i see is the plague doctor disappearing through the door a great stooped shadow dragging the world behind him
28   day five continued  life pounds on my eyelids
i blink once twice but it hurts to keep them open
my heads a shattered egg
a noise escapes my throat
its somewhere between a groan and a whimper the low animal gurgle of a creature caught in a trap
i try to heave myself up but the pains an ocean lapping around my skull
i dont have the strength to lift it
time passes i cant say how much
it isnt that sort of time
i watch my stomach rise and fall and when im confident it can do so without my help i drag myself into a sitting position resting against the crumbling wall
much to my dismay im back in jonathan derby lying on the floor in the nursery
pieces of a broken vase are everywhere including my scalp
somebody must have hit me from behind when i left stanwins bedroom and then dragged me here out of sight
the letter you fool
my hand leaps to my pocket searching for felicitys letter and the ledger i stole from stanwin but theyre gone along with the key to bells trunk
all that remains are the two headache pills given to me by anna which are still wrapped in the blue handkerchief
shes going to betray you
could this be her doing
the plague doctors warning couldnt have been any clearer and yet surely an enemy wouldnt provoke such feelings of warmth or kinship
perhaps anna does remember more from our last loop than she admits but if that information was destined to make us enemies why would i drag her name from one life into the next knowing i would chase it like a dog after a burning stick
no if theres betrayal afoot its a result of the empty promises ive made and thats rectifiable
i need to find the right way of telling anna the truth
swallowing the tablets dry i claw my way up the wall staggering back into stanwins room
the bodyguards still unconscious on the bed the light fading beyond the window
i check my watch to find its 6pm which means the hunters including stanwin are probably already on their way home
for all i know theyre crossing the lawn or ascending the stairs even now
i need to leave before the blackmailer comes back
even with the tablets im woozy the world slipping beneath me as i crash through the east wing before pushing aside the curtain to arrive on the landing above the entrance hall
each step is a battle until i fall through doctor dickies door nearly vomiting on his floor
his bedrooms identical to all the others on this corridor with a fourposter bed against one wall and a bath and sink behind a screen opposite
unlike bell dickies made himself at home
pictures of his grandchildren are dotted about the place a crucifix hanging from one of the walls
hes even laid a small rug down presumably to keep his feet off the cold wood in the mornings
this familiarity with oneself is a miracle to me and i find myself gaping at dickies possessions my wounds momentarily forgotten
picking up the picture of his grandchildren i wonder for the first time if i too have a family waiting beyond blackheath parents or children friends who miss me
startled by footsteps passing in the corridor i drop the family picture on the bedside table accidentally cracking the glass
the steps pass without incident but awakened to the peril i move more quickly
dickies medical bag is nestled beneath his bed and i upend it over his mattress spilling bottles scissors syringes and bandages onto the covers
the last thing out is a king james bible which bounces onto the floor the pages falling open
just like the one in sebastian bells bedroom certain words and paragraphs are underlined in red ink
its a code
a wolfs smile spreads across derbys face recognition of another crook
if i had to guess id say dickies a silent partner in bells drugpeddling business
no wonder he was so concerned for the good doctors welfare
he was worried about what hed say
i snort
its another secret in a house full of them and its not the one im after today
gathering the bandages and iodine from the pile on the bed i take them over to the sink and begin my surgery
its not a delicate operation
every time i pluck one piece loose blood wells up between my fingers running down my face and dripping off my chin into the sink
tears of pain cloud my vision the world a stinging blur for nearly thirty minutes while i pick apart my porcelain crown
my only consolation is that this must be hurting jonathan derby almost as much as its hurting me
when im certain every shard has been removed i set to work wrapping my head in bandages securing them with a safety pin and inspecting my work in the mirror
the bandages look fine
i look terrible
my face is pale my eyes hollow
blood has stained my shirt forcing me to strip down to my vest
im a man undone coming apart at the seams
i can feel myself unravelling
what the devil cries doctor dickie from the door
hes fresh from the hunt dripping wet and shivering grey as the ashes in the grate
even his moustache is sagging
i follow his disbelieving gaze around the room seeing the devastation through his eyes
the picture of his grandchildren is cracked and smeared with blood his bible discarded his medical bag tossed on the floor its contents scattered across the bed
bloody water fills the sink my shirt in his bathtub
his surgery cant look much worse after an amputation
catching sight of me in my vest the bandage trailing loose from my forehead the shock on his face turns to anger
what have you done jonathan he demands his voice swelling with rage
im sorry i didnt know where else to go i say panicked
after you left i searched stanwins room for something to help mother and i found a ledger  a ledger he says in a strangled voice
you took something from him
you must put it back
now jonathan he yells sensing my hesitation
i cant i was attacked
somebody smashed a vase across my head and stole it
i was bleeding and the bodyguard was going to wake up so i came here  a dreadful silence swallows the end of the story as doctor dickie stands the picture of his grandchildren upright and slowly gathers everything back into his medical bag sliding it back under the bed
he moves as though manacled dragging my secrets behind him
its my fault he mutters
i knew you werent to be trusted but my affection for your mother  he shakes his head pushing by me to collect my shirt from the bathtub
theres a resignation to his actions that frightens me
i didnt mean to i begin
you used me to steal from ted stanwin he says quietly gripping the edges of the counter
a man who can ruin me with a snap of his fingers  im sorry i say
he turns suddenly his anger thick
youve made that word cheap jonathan
you said it after we covered up that business in enderleigh house and again at little hampton
remember
now youd have me swallow this hollow apology as well  he presses my shirt against my chest his cheeks flushed red
tears stand in his eyes
how many women have you forced yourself upon
do you even remember
how many times have you wept at your mothers breast begging her to fix it promising never to do it again and knowing full well that you would
and now here you are again doing the same to me bloody stupid doctor dickie
well im done i cant stomach it any more
youve been a blight on this world ever since i brought you into it  i take an imploring step towards him but he pulls a silver pistol from his pocket letting it dangle by his side
hes not even looking at me
get out jonathan or by god ill shoot you myself  keeping one eye on the pistol i back out of the room closing the door as i step into the corridor
my hearts thumping
doctor dickies gun is the very same one evelyn will use to take her life tonight
hes holding the murder weapon
29   quite how long i stare at jonathan derby in my bedroom mirror its impossible to say
im looking for the man within some hint of my real face
i want derby to see his executioner
whisky warms my throat the bottle plundered from the drawing room and already half empty
i need it to stop my hands from shaking as i try to knot my bow tie
doctor dickies testimony confirmed what i already knew
derbys a monster his crimes washed away by his mothers money
theres no justice waiting for this man no trial or punishment
if hes to pay for what hes done ill have to march him to the gallows myself and thats what i intend to do
first though were going to save evelyn hardcastles life
my gaze is drawn towards doctor dickies silver pistol lying harmless on an armchair like a fly swatted out of the air
stealing it was a simple matter as easy as sending a servant with an invented emergency to lure the doctor out of his room while i slipped in afterwards and took it from his nightstand
for too long ive allowed this day to dictate terms to me but no longer
if somebody wishes to murder evelyn with this pistol theyll have to come through me first
the plague doctors riddle be damned
i dont trust him and i wont stand idly by while horrors play out in front of me
its time jonathan derby finally did some good on this earth
slipping the pistol into my jacket pocket i take one last mouthful of whisky and step out into the corridor following the other guests down the staircase to dinner
unlike their manners their taste is impeccable
evening gowns expose naked backs and pale skin adorned with glittering jewellery
the listlessness of earlier is gone their charm extravagant
at last as evening calls theyve come alive
as always i keep an eye out for some hint of the footman among these passing faces
hes long overdue a visit and the longer the day goes on the more certain i become that something dreadful is coming
at least itll be a fair fight
derby has very few laudable qualities but his anger makes him a handful
ive barely been able to keep hold of him so i cant imagine what it would be like to see him flying at you dripping hate
michael hardcastles standing in the entrance hall with a paintedon smile greeting those coming down the stairs as though genuinely glad to see every last wretched one of them
i had intended on questioning him about the mysterious felicity maddox and the note at the well but it will have to wait until later
theres an impregnable wall of taffeta and bow ties between us
piano music drags me through the crowds into the long gallery where guests are mingling with drinks as servants prepare the dining hall on the other side of the doors
taking a whisky from one of the passing trays i keep an eye out for millicent
id hoped to give derby his goodbyes but shes nowhere to be seen
in fact the only person i recognise is sebastian bell whos drifting through the entrance hall on his way to his room
stopping a maid i ask after helena hardcastle hoping the lady of the house might be near at hand but she hasnt arrived
that means shes been missing all day
absence has officially become disappearance
it cant be coincidence that lady hardcastle is nowhere to be found on the day of her daughters death though whether shes a suspect or a victim i cant be sure
one way or another im going to find out
my glass is empty my head becoming foggy
im surrounded by laughter and conversation friends and lovers
the good cheer is stirring derbys bitterness
i can feel his disgust his loathing
he hates these people this world
he hates himself
servants slip past me with silver platters evelyns last meal arriving in a procession
why isnt she afraid
i can hear her laughter from here
shes mingling with the guests as though all her days lie ahead yet when ravencourt brought up the danger this morning it was clear she knew something was amiss
discarding my glass i make my way through the entrance hall and into the corridor towards evelyns bedroom
if there are answers perhaps thats where ill find them
the lamps have been lowered to dim flames
its quiet and oppressive a forgotten edge of the world
im halfway up the passage when i notice a splash of red emerging from the shadows
a footmans livery
hes blocking the passage
i freeze
glancing behind me i try to work out whether i can reach the entrance hall before hes on me
the odds are slim
im not even sure my legs will listen when i tell them to move
sorry sir says a chirpy voice the footman taking a step closer and revealing himself to be a short wiry boy no more than thirteen with pimples and a nervous smile
excuse me he adds after a moment and i realise im in his way
mumbling an apology i let him pass and blow out an explosive breath
the footmans made me so afraid the mere suggestion of his presence is enough to cripple even derby a man whod throw a punch at the sun because it burnt him
was that his intention
the reason he taunted bell and ravencourt rather than killing them
if this continues hell be able to pick off my hosts without a shred of resistance
im earning the rabbit nickname hes given me
proceeding cautiously i continue to evelyns bedroom finding it locked
knocking brings no answer and unwilling to leave without something to show for my efforts i take a step backwards intending to put my shoulder through it
thats when i notice the door to helenas bedroom is in exactly the same place as the door into ravencourts parlour
poking my head into both rooms i find the dimensions are identical
that suggests evelyns bedroom was once a parlour
if thats the case there will be a connecting door from helenas room which is useful because the lock is still broken from this morning
my guess is proven correct the connecting door is hidden behind an ornate tapestry hanging on the wall
thankfully its unlocked and im able to slip through into evelyns room
given her fractured relationship with her parents id half expected to find her sleeping in a broom closet but the bedroom is comfortable enough if modest
theres a fourposter bed at the centre a bathtub and bowl behind a curtain on a rail
evidently the maid hasnt been allowed in for some time because the bath is full of cold dirty water towels discarded in soggy heaps on the floor a necklace tossed carelessly on the dressing table beside a pile of scrunchedup tissues all stained with makeup
the curtains are drawn evelyns fire piled high with logs
four oil lamps stand in the corners of the room pinching the gloom between their flickering light and that of the fireplace
im shaking with pleasure derbys excitement at this intrusion a warm blush rising through my body
i can feel my spirit trying to recoil from my host and its all i can do to hold onto myself as i sift through evelyns possessions searching for anything that might drive her towards the reflecting pool later tonight
shes a messy sort discarded clothes stuffed wherever they happen to fit costume jewellery heaped in the drawers tangled up with old scarves and shawls
theres no system no order no hint that she allows a maid anywhere near her things
whatever her secrets shes hiding them from more than me
i catch myself stroking a silk blouse frowning at my own hand before realising its not me that wants this its him
its derby
with a cry i pull my hand back slamming the wardrobe shut
i can feel his yearning
hed have me on my knees pawing through her belongings inhaling her scent
hes a beast and for a second he had control
wiping the beads of desire from my forehead i take a deep breath to collect myself before pushing on with the search
i narrow my concentration to a point keeping hold of my thoughts allowing no gap for him to creep through
even so the investigation is fruitless
about the only item of interest is an old scrapbook containing curios from evelyns life old correspondence between herself and michael pictures from her childhood scraps of poetry and musings from her adolescence all combining to present a portrait of a very lonely woman who loved her brother desperately and now misses him terribly
closing the book i push it back under the bed where i found it departing the room as quietly as i came dragging a thrashing derby within me
30   im sitting in an armchair in a dim corner of the entrance hall the seat arranged to give me a clear view to evelyns bedroom door
dinners under way but evelyn will be dead in three hours and i plan to dog her every step to the reflecting pool
such patience would normally be beyond my host but ive discovered that he enjoys smoking which is handy because it makes me lightheaded dulling the cancer of derby in my thoughts
its a pleasant if unexpected benefit of this inherited habit
theyll be ready when you need them says cunningham appearing through the fog and crouching by my chair
theres a pleased grin on his face i can make neither head nor tail of
wholl be ready i say looking at him
this grin disappears embarrassment taking its place as he lurches to his feet
im sorry mr derby i thought you were somebody else he says hastily
i am somebody else cunningham its me aiden
i still dont have the foggiest idea what youre talking about though  you asked me to get some people together he says
no i didnt  our confusions must mirror each other because cunninghams face has twisted into the same knot as my brain
im sorry he said youd understand says cunningham
who said  a sound draws my attention to the entrance hall and turning in my seat i see evelyn fleeing across the marble weeping into her hands
take this i have to go says cunningham thrusting a piece of paper into my hand with the phrase all of them written on it
wait
i dont know what this means i call after him but its too late hes already gone
id follow him but michael is chasing evelyn into the entrance hall and this is why im here
these are the missing moments that transform evelyn from the brave kind woman i met as bell into the suicidal heiress wholl take her life by the reflecting pool
evie evie dont go tell me what i can do says michael catching her arm at the elbow
she shakes her head tears sparkling in the candlelight mirroring the diamonds flashing in her hair
i just her voice chokes
i need to  shaking her head she shrugs him off flying past me towards her bedroom
fumbling the key into the lock she slips inside slamming the door shut behind her
michael watches her go despondently grabbing a glass of port from the tray madelines carrying to the dining hall
it disappears in one gulp his cheeks flushing
lifting the tray out of her hands he waves the maid towards evelyns bedroom
dont worry about this see to your mistress he orders
its a grand gesture somewhat undone by the confusion that follows as he tries to work out what to do with the thirty glasses of sherry port and brandy hes inherited
from my seat i watch madeline rap on evelyns door the poor maid becoming increasingly upset with every ignored entreaty
finally she returns to the entrance hall where michael is still casting around for somewhere to put the tray
im afraid mademoiselle is madeline makes a despairing gesture
its fine madeline michael says wearily
its been a difficult day
why dont you leave her be for now
im sure shell call when she needs you  madeline lingers uncertainly looking back towards evelyns bedroom but after a brief hesitation she does as he asks disappearing down the servants staircase towards the kitchen
casting left and right for somewhere to dispense with the tray michael spots me watching him
i must look a damned fool he says blushing
more like an inept waiter i say bluntly
i assume the dinner didnt go as planned  its this business with ravencourt he says balancing the tray rather precariously across the padded arms of a nearby chair
do you have one of those cigarettes spare  i emerge from the fog to hand him one lighting it in his fingers
does she really have to marry him i ask
were almost broke old chum he sighs taking a long drag
fathers buying up every empty mine and blighted plantation in the empire
i give it a year or two before our coffers are completely dry  but i thought evelyn and your parents didnt get on
why would she agree to go through with it  for me he says shaking his head
my parents threatened to cut me off if she doesnt obey them
id be flattered if i didnt feel so damn guilty about it all  there must be another way  fathers wrung every penny he can out of those few banks still impressed by his title
if we dont get this money well truth be told i dont know what will happen but well end up poor and im fairly certain well be dreadful at it  most people are i say
well at least theyve had practice he says tapping ash onto the marble floor
why is there a bandage on your head  i touch it selfconsciously having quite forgotten it was there
i got on the wrong side of stanwin i say
i heard him arguing with evelyn about somebody called felicity maddox and tried to intervene  felicity he says recognition showing on his face
you know the name  he pauses taking a deep puff of his cigarette before exhaling slowly
old friend of my sister he says
cant imagine why theyd be arguing about her
evelyn hasnt seen her in years  shes here in blackheath i say
she left a note for evelyn at the well  are you certain he asks sceptically
she wasnt on the guest list and evelyn didnt say anything to me  were interrupted by a noise at the doorway doctor dickie hurrying towards me
he places a hand on my shoulder and leans close to my ear
its your mother he whispers
you need to come with me  whatevers happened its dreadful enough for him to have buried his antipathy towards me
apologising to michael i run after the doctor my dread growing with every step until finally he ushers me into her bedroom
the windows open a cold gust snatching at the candle flames lighting the room
it takes my eyes a few seconds to adjust to the dimness but finally i find her
millicents lying on her side in bed eyes closed and chest still as though she crawled under the covers for a quick nap
shed begun dressing for dinner and has combed her usually wild grey hair straight tying it up away from her face
im sorry jonathan i know how close you were he says
grief squeezes me
no matter how much i tell myself that this woman isnt my mother i cant make it let go
my tears arrive suddenly and silently
trembling i sit down in the wooden chair beside her bed taking her stillwarm hand in mine
it was a heart attack says doctor dickie in a pained voice
it would have happened very suddenly  hes standing on the other side of the bed the emotion as raw on his face as my own
wiping away a tear he pulls the window shut cutting off the cold breeze
the candles stand to attention the light in the room solidifying into a warm golden glow
can i warn her i say thinking of the things i can put right tomorrow
he looks puzzled for a second but clearly ascribes the question to grief and answers me in a kind voice
no he says shaking his head
you couldnt have warned her  what if  it was just her time jonathan he says softly
i nod its all i can manage
he stays a little longer wrapping me in words i neither hear nor feel
my grief is a bottomless well
all i can do is fall and hope to hit the bottom
yet the deeper i go the more i realise im not weeping solely for millicent derby
theres something else down here something deeper than my hosts grief something that belongs to aiden bishop
its raw and desperate sad and angry beating at the core of me
derbys grief has revealed it but hard as i try i cant quite pull it up out of the dark
leave it buried
what is it  a piece of you now leave it alone
a knock at the door distracts me and looking at the clock i realise over an hours passed
theres no sign of the doctor
he must have left without me noticing
evelyn pokes her head into the room
her face is pale cheeks red with cold
shes still dressed in the blue ball gown though its picked up a few creases since i last saw her
the tiara is poking from the pocket of her long beige coat wellington boots leaving a trail of mud and leaves on the floor
she must have only just returned from the graveyard with bell
evelyn  i intend to say more but i choke on my sorrow
evelyn gathers the shards of the moment together then tuts and enters the room heading straight for a bottle of whisky on the sideboard
the glass has barely touched my lips when she tips it upwards forcing me to drink it down in one swallow
gagging i push the glass away whisky running down my chin
why would you  well you can hardly help me in your current state she says
help you  shes studying me turning me over in her mind
she hands me a handkerchief
wipe your chin you look atrocious she says
im afraid sorrow doesnt suit that arrogant face at all well  how  its a very long story she says
and im afraid were somewhat pressed for time  i sit dumbly struggling to take everything in wishing for the clarity of ravencourts mind
so much has happened so much i cant quite piece together
i already felt as if i was staring at the clues through a foggy magnifying glass and now evelyns here tugging a bedsheet over millicents face calm as a summer day
try as i might i cant keep up
quite clearly that little tantrum at dinner regarding her engagement was an act because theres no trace of that crippling sadness about her now
her eyes are clear her tone contemplative
so im not the only one dying tonight she says stroking the old ladys hair
what a miserable thing  the glass falls from my hand in shock
you know about  the reflecting pool yes
curious affair isnt it  she has a dreamy tone as though describing something she once heard and now only half remembers
id suspect her mind of having buckled in some way if it werent for the hard edge to her words
you seem to be taking the news rather well i say cautiously
you should have seen me this morning i was so angry i was kicking holes in the walls  evelyns running her hand along the edge of the dressing table opening millicents jewellery box touching the pearlhandled brush
id describe her actions as covetous if there didnt appear to be an equal amount of reverence
who wants you dead evelyn i ask unnerved by this curious display
i dont know she says
there was a letter pushed under my door when i woke up
the instructions were quite specific  but you dont know who sent it  constable rashton has a theory but hes kept it rather close to his chest  rashton  your friend
he told me you were helping him investigate doubt and distaste seep out of every word but im too intrigued to take it personally
could this rashton be another host
maybe even the same man who asked cunningham to deliver that all of them message and gather some people together
either way he seems to have swept me up into his plan
whether i can trust it is another matter
where did rashton approach you i ask
mr derby she says firmly
id love nothing more than to sit down and answer all your questions but we dont really have time
im expected at the reflecting pool in ten minutes and i cant be late
in fact thats why im here i need the silver pistol you took from the doctor  you cant mean to go through with this i say jumping up from my seat in alarm
as i understand it your friends are close to unmasking my wouldbe killer
they simply need a little more time
if i dont go the killer will know something is wrong and i cant risk that  im beside her in two steps my pulse racing
are you saying they know whos behind all of this i say excitedly
did they give you any indication who it might be  evelyns holding one of millicent derbys cameos up to the light an ivory face on blue lace
her hand is shaking
its the first sign of fear ive seen from her
they didnt but i hope they find out soon
im trusting your friends to save me before im forced to do something final  final i say
the note was specific either i take my life out by the reflecting pool at 11 pm or somebody i care about very deeply dies in my stead  felicity i ask
i know you collected a note from her at the well and that you asked her for her assistance with your mother
michael said she was an old friend
is she in danger
is somebody holding her against her will  that would explain why i havent been able to find her
the jewellery box clatters shut
evelyn turns to face me hands now pressed flat against the dressing table
i dont mean to sound impatient but dont you have somewhere to be she says
i was asked to remind you about a rock that needs watching
does that make any sense to you  i nod remembering the favour anna asked of me earlier this afternoon
im to be standing by it when evelyn kills herself
i wasnt to move
not an inch shed said
in that case my work here is done and i should go says evelyn
wheres the silver pistol  even in her small fingers it seems an inconsequential thing more decoration than weapon an embarrassing way to end a life
i wonder if thats the point if theres not some quiet rebuke in the instrument of death as there is in the method
evelyn isnt merely being murdered shes being embarrassed dominated
every choice has been taken from her
what a pretty way to die says evelyn staring at the pistol
please dont be late mr derby i suspect my life depends upon it  after a final glance towards the jewellery box shes gone
31   hugging myself against the cold i stand over annas carefully placed rock terrified of taking even a small step to my left where at least id be warmed by one of the braziers
i dont know why im here but if its part of a plan to save evelyn ill stand in this spot until my blood turns to ice
glancing towards the trees i catch sight of the plague doctor in his usual location half hidden by gloom
hes not looking at the reflecting pool as i thought when i witnessed this moment through ravencourts eyes but away to his right
the angle of his head suggests hes talking to somebody though im too far away to see who
either way its an encouraging sign
evelyn suggested shed found allies among my hosts and surely in those bushes somebody is waiting to come to her aid
evelyn arrives at eleven exactly the silver pistol hanging limp in her hand
drifting from shadow to flame she follows the braziers her blue ball gown trailing in the grass
i long to tear the pistol from her grasp but somewhere beyond my sight an invisible hand is working pulling levers i cant possibly understand
any minute now somebody will call out im certain of it
one of my future hosts will come sprinting into the darkness telling evelyn its over and the murderer is captured
shell drop the gun and sob her thanks while daniel presents his plan for both anna and me to escape
for the first time since all this began i feel myself part of something bigger
encouraged by this i root my feet hovering over my rock
evelyns come to a stop at the edge of the water looking around at the trees
for a second i think shell spot the plague doctor but she pulls her gaze back before reaching him
shes unsteady swaying slightly as though moved by some music only she can hear
the flames from the brazier are reflected in the diamonds of her necklace liquid fire pouring down her throat
shes trembling desperation mounting on her face
somethings wrong
i glance back towards the ballroom to find ravencourt at the window looking longingly towards his friend
words are forming on his lips but theyre too late to do any good
god help me evelyn whispers to the night
tears streaming down her cheeks she turns the gun towards her stomach and pulls the trigger
the shot is so loud it cracks the world drowning out my anguished scream
in the ballroom the party holds its breath
surprised faces turn towards the reflecting pool their eyes seeking out evelyn
shes clutching her stomach blood seeping out from between her fingers
she looks confused as though shes been handed something she shouldnt have been but before she can make sense of it she buckles falling forwards into the water
fireworks explode in the night sky as guests stream through the french doors pointing and gasping
somebodys running towards me their footsteps pounding the dirt
i turn in time to take their full weight in my chest sending me sprawling to the ground
trying to scramble to their feet they only succeed in scraping my face with their fingers a knee jabbing into my stomach
derbys temper already clawing to be let out takes hold of me
with a scream of rage i begin pounding at this shape in the darkness clutching their clothing even as they try to wrestle their way free
howling in frustration im pulled off the ground my opponent similarly lofted away both of us held fast by servants
lantern light spills across us revealing a furious michael hardcastle desperately trying to break free of cunninghams strong arms which are keeping him from evelyns stricken form
i stare at him in astonishment
its changed
the revelation knocks the fight out of me my body going limp in the servants arms as i stare at the reflecting pool
when i saw this event as ravencourt michael clung to his sister unable to move her
now a tall fellow in a trench coat is pulling her out of the water covering her bloodsoaked body with dickies jacket
the servant lets me go and i drop to my knees in time to see a sobbing michael hardcastle led away by cunningham
determined to soak up as much of this miracle as possible my gaze darts this way and that
up by the reflecting pool doctor dickies kneeling by evelyns body discussing something with the other man who appears to be in charge
ravencourts retreated to a couch in the ballroom and is sitting slumped over his cane lost in thought
the band is being harangued by drunken guests who oblivious to the horror outside want them to carry on playing while servants stand idle crossing themselves when they draw closer to the body under the jacket
heaven knows how long i sit there in the darkness watching all this unfold
long enough for everybody else to be ushered into the house by the fellow in the trench coat
long enough for evelyns limp body to be carried away
long enough to grow cold to grow stiff
long enough for the footman to find me
he appears around the far corner of the house a small sack tied to his waist blood dripping off his hands
taking out his knife he begins drawing the blade back and forth across the rim of a brazier
i cant tell whether hes sharpening it or simply warming it but i suspect its irrelevant
he wants me to see it to hear that unsettling scrape of metal against metal
hes watching me waiting for my reaction and looking at him now i wonder how anybody ever mistook him for a servant
though hes dressed in a footmans red and white livery he possesses none of the traditional subservience
hes tall and thin languid in his movements with dirty blond hair and a teardrop face dark eyes above a smirk that would be charming if it werent so empty
and then theres that broken nose
its purple and swollen distorting his features
by the light of the fire he looks like a creature dressing up as human the mask slipping
the footman holds up the knife to better inspect his work
satisfied he uses it to cut the sack from his waist tossing it at my feet
it hits the ground with a thud the material soaked through with blood and tied shut with a drawstring
he wants me to open it but i have no intention of indulging him
getting to my feet i peel off my jacket and work loose the kinks in my neck
in the back of my mind i can hear anna screaming at me demanding i run
shes right i should be afraid and in any other host i would be
this is clearly a trap but im tired of fearing this man
its time to fight if only to convince myself i can
for a moment we watch each other the rain falling and the wind swirling
unsurprisingly its the footman who forces the issue turning on his heel and sprinting into the darkness of the forest
bellowing like a lunatic i charge after him
as i cross into the forest the trees huddle around me branches scratch my face the foliage thickening
my legs are tiring but i keep running until i realise i cant hear him any more
skidding to a halt i spin on the spot panting
hes on me in seconds covering my mouth to stifle my scream as the blade enters my side and tears up into my ribcage blood burbling into my throat
my knees buckle but im prevented from falling by his strong arms around me
hes breathing shallowly eagerly
this isnt the sound of tiredness its excitement and anticipation
a match flares a tiny point of light held in front of my face
hes kneeling down directly opposite his pitiless black eyes boring into me
brave rabbit he says slitting my throat
32   day six  wake up
wake up aiden  somebodys banging on my door
you have to wake up aiden
aiden  swallowing my tiredness i blink at my surroundings
im in a chair clammy with sweat my clothes twisted tight around me
its night time a candle guttering on a nearby table
theres a tartan blanket over my lap old mans hands laid across a dogeared book
veins bulge in wrinkled flesh crisscrossing dry ink stains and liver spots
i flex my fingers stiff with age
aiden please says the voice in the corridor
rising from my chair i move to the door old aches stirring throughout my body like swarms of disturbed hornets
the hinges are loose the bottom corner of the door scraping against the floor revealing the lanky figure of gregory gold on the other side slumped against the doorframe
he looks much as he will when he attacks the butler though his dinner jackets torn and caked with mud his breathing ragged
hes clutching the chess piece anna gave me and that together with his use of my real name is enough to convince me that hes another of my hosts
normally id welcome such a meeting but hes in a frightful state agitated and dishevelled a man dragged to hell and back
upon seeing me he grips my shoulders
his dark eyes are bloodshot flicking this way and that
dont get out of the carriage he says spittle hanging off his lips
whatever you do dont get out of the carriage  his fear is a disease the infection spreading through me
what happened to you i ask a tremor in my voice
he he never stops  never stops what i ask
golds shaking his head pounding his temples
tears stream down his cheeks but i dont know how to begin comforting him
never stops what gold i ask again
cutting he says drawing up his sleeve to reveal the slices beneath
they look exactly like the knife wounds bell woke up with that first morning
you wont want to you wont but youll give her up youll tell youll tell them everything you wont want to but youll tell he babbles
theres two of them
two
they look the same but theres two  his minds broken i can see that now
there isnt an ounce of sanity left to the man
i reach out a hand hoping to draw him into the room but he takes fright backing away until he bumps into the far wall only his voice remaining
dont get out of the carriage he hisses at me wheeling away down the corridor
i take a step out after him but its too dark to see anything and by the time i return with a candle the corridors empty
33   day two continued  the butlers body the butlers pain heavy with sedative
its like coming home
im barely awake and already slipping back towards sleep
its getting dark
a mans pacing back and forth across the tiny room a shotgun in his arms
its not the plague doctor
its not gold
he hears me stir and turns around
hes in shade i cant make him out
i open my mouth but no words come out of it
i close my eyes and slip away again
34   day six continued  father  im startled to find the freckled face of a young man with red hair and blue eyes inches from my own
im old again sitting in my chair with the tartan blanket across my lap
the boy is bent at ninety degrees hands clasped behind his back as though he doesnt trust them in company
my scowl shoves him a step backwards
you asked me to wake you at ninefifteen he says apologetically
he smells of scotch tobacco and fear
it wells up within him staining the whites of his eyes yellow
theyre wary and hunted like an animal waiting for the shot
its light beyond the window my candle long gone out and the fire down to ash
my vague memory of being the butler proves i dozed off after golds visit but i dont remember doing so
the horror of what gold endured – what i must soon endure – kept me pacing into the early hours
dont get out of the carriage
it was a warning and a plea
he wants me to change the day and while thats exhilarating its also disturbing
i know it can be done ive seen it but if im clever enough to change things the footman is as well
for all i know were running in circles undoing each others work
this is no longer simply about finding the right answer its about holding onto it long enough to deliver it to the plague doctor
i have to speak with the artist at the first opportunity
i shift in my seat tugging aside the tartan blanket bringing the slightest flinch from the boy
he stiffens looking at me sideways to see if ive noticed
poor child hes had all the bravery beaten out of him and now hes kicked for being a coward
my sympathy fares ill with my host whose distaste for his son is absolute
he considers this boys meekness infuriating his silence an affront
hes a failure an unforgivable failure
my only one
i shake my head trying to free myself of this mans regrets
the memories of bell ravencourt and derby were objects in a fog but the clutter of this current life is scattered around me
i cannot help but trip over it
despite the suggestion of infirmity given by the blanket i rise with only a little stiffness stretching to a respectable height
my sons retreated to the corner of the room draping himself in shadows
though the distance is not great its too far for my host whose eyes falter at half the span
i search for spectacles knowing its pointless
this man considers age a weakness the result of a faltering will
therell be no spectacles no walking stick no aid of any sort
whatever burdens are heaped upon me theyre mine to endure
alone
i can feel my son weighing my mood watching my face as one watches the clouds for an approaching storm
spit it out i say gruffly agitated by his reticence
i was hoping i might be excused this afternoons hunt he says
the words are laid at my feet two dead rabbits for a hungry wolf
even this simple request grates upon me
what young man doesnt want to hunt
what young man creeps and crawls tiptoeing around the edges of the world rather than trampling across the top of it
my urge is to refuse to make him suffer for the temerity of being who he is but i bite the desire back
well both be happier beyond each others company
very well i say waving him away
thank you father he says escaping the room before i can change my mind
in his absence my breathing eases my hands unclench
anger takes its arms from around my chest leaving me free to investigate the room for some reflection of its owner
books lie three thick on the bedside table all dealing in the murky details of law
my invitation to the ball is being used as a bookmark and is addressed to edward and rebecca dance
that name alone is enough to make me crumble
i remember rebeccas face her smell
the feeling of being near her
my fingers find the locket around my neck her portrait cradled inside
dances grief is a quiet ache a single tear once a day
its the only luxury he allows himself
pushing aside the grief i drum the invite with my finger
dance i murmur
a peculiar name for such a joyless man
knocking perforates the silence the handle turning and the door opening seconds later
the fellow who enters is large and shambling scratching a head full of white hair dislodging dandruff in every direction
hes wearing a rumpled blue suit below white whiskers and bloodshot red eyes and would look quite frightful if it werent for the comfort with which he carries his dishevelment
he pauses midscratch blinking at me in bewilderment
this your room is it edward asks the stranger
well i woke up here i say warily
blast i cant remember where they put me  where did you sleep last night  sun room he says scratching an armpit
herrington bet me i couldnt finish a bottle of port in under fifteen minutes and thats the last thing i remember until that scoundrel gold woke me up this morning ranting and raving like a lunatic  the mention of gold takes me back to his rambling warning last night and the scars on his arm
dont get out of the carriage hed said
does that suggest ill be leaving at some point
or taking a journey
i already know i cant reach the village so it seems unlikely
did gold say anything i ask
do you know where he was going or what his plans were  i didnt stop and sup with the man dance he says dismissively
i took his measure and let him know in no uncertain terms i had my eye on him he glances around
did i leave a bottle in here
need something to quieten this damnable headache  ive barely opened my mouth to respond when he starts rooting through my drawers leaving them standing open as he turns his assault upon the wardrobe
after patting down the pockets of my suits he spins surveying the room as though hes just heard a lion in the bushes
another knock another face
this one belongs to commander clifford herrington the boring naval chap who was sitting next to ravencourt at dinner
come along you two he says checking his watch
old hardcastles waiting for us  freed from the blight of strong alcohol hes straightbacked and authoritative
any idea what he wants from us i ask
none whatsoever but i expect hell tell us when we get there he responds briskly
i need my walking scotch says my companion
theres sure to be some over at the gatehouse sutcliffe says herrington not bothering to hide his impatience
besides you know hardcastle hes damned serious these days probably best if we dont turn up halfcut  such is the strength of my connection to dance that the mere mention of lord hardcastle causes me to puff out my cheeks in annoyance
my hosts presence in blackheath is a matter of obligation a fleeting visit lasting only so long as it takes to conclude his business with the family
in contrast im desperate to question the master of the house about his missing wife and my enthusiasm for our meeting is rubbing up against dances agitation like sandpaper on skin
somehow im annoying myself
badgered once again by the impatient naval officer the shambling sutcliffe holds up a hand begging an extra minute before turning his desperate fingers loose among my shelves
sniffing the air he lurches towards the bed lifting the mattress to reveal a pilfered bottle of scotch on the springs
lead on herrington old boy he says magnanimously unscrewing the cap and taking a hearty slug
shaking his head herrington gestures us out into the corridor where sutcliffe begins telling a boisterous joke at the top of his voice his friend trying unsuccessfully to quieten him
theyre buffoons both their good cheer possessing an arrogance that sets my teeth on edge
my host has little time for excess of any kind and would happily stride off ahead but i do not want to walk these corridors alone
as a compromise i follow two steps behind far enough away that i dont have to join the conversation but close enough to give the footman pause should he be lurking nearby
were met at the bottom of the stairs by somebody called christopher pettigrew who turns out to be the oily chap daniel was conferring with at dinner
hes a thin man built to sneer with dark greasy hair swept over to one side
hes as stooping and sly as i remember his gaze running its hands through my pockets before taking in my face
i wondered two nights ago if he might be a future host but if so i must have given myself freely to his vices as hes already soft with alcohol happily taking up the bottle being shared between his chums
it never veers in my direction meaning i never have to refuse
clearly edward dance stands apart from this rabble and im happy its so
theyre a queer bunch friends certainly but desperately so like three men stranded on the same island
thankfully their good cheer fades the further we draw from the house their laughter whipped away by the wind and rain the bottle forced into a warm pocket along with the cold hand holding it
did anybody else get yapped at by ravencourts poodle this morning says the oily pettigrew whos little more than a pair of deceitful eyes above a scarf at this point
whats his name again  he clicks his fingers trying to summon the memory
charles cunningham i say distantly only half listening
further along the path im certain i saw somebody shadowing us in the trees
just a flash enough for doubt except they appeared to be wearing a footmans livery
my hand goes to my throat and for an instant i feel his blade again
shuddering i squint at the trees trying to wring some use out of dances awful eyes but if it was my enemy hes gone now
thats the one charles bloody cunningham says pettigrew
was he asking about thomas hardcastles murder says herrington his face turned resolutely towards the wind no doubt a habit of his naval background
i heard he was up visiting stanwin this morning collared him first thing he adds
damned impertinent says pettigrew
what about you dance did he come sniffing around  not that im aware i say still staring at the forest
were passing close to the spot where i thought i spotted the footman but now i see the splash of colour is a red trail marker nailed to a tree
my imaginations painting monsters in the woods
what did cunningham want i say reluctantly returning my attention to my companions
its not him says pettigrew
he was asking questions on behalf of ravencourt seems the fat old bankers taken an interest in thomas hardcastles murder  that brings me up short
of all the tasks i set cunningham when i was ravencourt asking questions about thomas hardcastles murder wasnt one of them
whatever cunninghams doing hes using ravencourts name to curry favour
perhaps this is part of the secret he was so keen to keep me from revealing the secret which still needs to find its way into an envelope beneath the chair in the library
what sort of questions i say my interest kindled for the first time
kept asking me about the second killer the one stanwin said he clipped with his shotgun before he escaped says herrington whos tipping a hip flask to his lips
wanted to know if there were any rumours about who they were any descriptions  were there i ask
never heard anything says herrington
wouldnt have told him if i had
sent him away with a flea in his ear  not surprised cecils got cunningham on it though adds sutcliffe scratching his whiskers
hes thick as thieves with every charwoman and gardener who ever took a shilling at blackheath probably knows more about this place than we do  hows that i ask
he was living here when the murder happened says sutcliffe glancing over his shoulder at me
just a boy back then of course bit older than evelyn as i remember
rumour had it he was peters bastard
helena gave him to the cook to raise or something like that
never could work out who she was punishing  his voice is thoughtful a rather strange sound coming from this shaggy shapeless creature
pretty little thing that cook lost her husband in the war he muses
the hardcastles paid for the boys education even got him the job with ravencourt when he came of age  whats ravencourt want with a nineteenyearold murder asks pettigrew
due diligence says herrington bluntly stepping around horse manure
ravencourts buying a hardcastle he wants to know what baggage shes bringing along  their conversation swiftly frays into trivialities but my thoughts remain fixed on cunningham
last night he pressed a note into derbys hand that read all of them and told me he was rounding up guests on behalf of a future host
that would suggest i can trust him but he clearly has his own agenda in blackheath
i know hes peter hardcastles illegitimate son and that hes asking questions about the murder of his halfbrother
somewhere between those two facts is a secret hes so desperate to keep hes allowed himself to be blackmailed with it
i grit my teeth
for once it would be refreshing to find somebody in this place who was exactly what they appeared to be
passing the cobbled path towards the stables we push south along the neverending road into the village before finally coming upon the gatehouse
one by one we fill the narrow corridor hanging our coats and shaking the rain free of our clothes while complaining about the conditions outside
through here chaps says a voice from behind a door on our right
we follow the voice into a gloomy sitting room lit by an open fire where lord peter hardcastle is sitting in an armchair near the window
he has one leg flung across the other a book flat on his lap
hes somewhat older than his portrait suggested though still broad chested and fitlooking
dark eyebrows slide towards each other in a vshape pointing towards a long nose and mopey mouth curved downwards at the edges
a ragged spectre of beauty suggests itself but his stash of splendour has almost run dry
why the hell are we meeting all the way out here asks pettigrew grumpily dropping into a chair
youve a perfectly good – he waves in the direction of blackheath – well youve got something that resembles a house down the road  that damn house has been a curse on this family ever since i was a boy says peter hardcastle pouring drinks into five glasses
i wont set foot inside until its absolutely necessary  perhaps you should have thought of that before throwing historys most tasteless party says pettigrew
do you really intend on announcing evelyns engagement on the anniversary of your own sons murder  do you think any of this is my idea asks hardcastle slamming the bottle down and glaring at pettigrew
do you think i want to be here  easy peter soothes sutcliffe shambling over to awkwardly pat his friends shoulder
christophers grumpy because well hes christopher  of course says hardcastle whose red cheeks suggest anything but understanding
its just helenas acting damn queer and now all this
its been quite trying  he goes back to pouring drinks an uneasy silence gagging everything but the rain thumping on the windows
personally im glad of the quiet and the chair
my companions walked quickly and keeping up was a chore
i need to catch my breath and pride dictates that nobody notice me doing it
in lieu of conversation i look around the room but theres little worthy of scrutiny
its long and narrow with furniture piled up against the walls like wreckage on a riverbank
the carpet is worn through the flowery wallpaper gaudy
age is thick in the air as though the last owners sat here until they crumbled into dust
its nowhere near as uncomfortable as the east wing where stanwin has sequestered himself but its still an odd place to find the lord of the house
ive not had cause to ask what lord hardcastles role in his daughters murder might be but his choice of lodging suggests hes looking to stay out of sight
the question is what is he doing with that anonymity
drinks are deposited before us hardcastle resuming his former seat
hes rolling his glass between his palms gathering his thoughts
theres an endearing awkwardness to his manner that immediately reminds me of michael
to my left sutcliffe – whos already halfway through his scotch and soda – digs a document from his jacket and hands it to me indicating that i should pass it along to hardcastle
its a marriage contract drafted by the firm dance pettigrew  sutcliffe
evidently myself the lugubrious philip sutcliffe and the oily christopher pettigrew are business partners
even so im certain hardcastle hasnt brought us here to talk about evelyns nuptials
hes too distracted for that too fidgety
besides why request herringtons presence if you only needed your solicitors
confirming my suspicion hardcastle takes the contract from me offering it the faintest of glances before dropping it on the table
dance and i worked on it ourselves says sutcliffe rising to fetch another drink
have ravencourt and evelyn put their signatures on the bottom and youre a rich man again
ravencourt will pay a lump sum upon signing with the outstanding amount held in trust until after the ceremony
in a couple of years hell take blackheath off your hands as well
not a bad piece of work if i do say so myself  where is old ravencourt asks pettigrew glancing at the door
shouldnt he be here for this  helenas looking after him says hardcastle taking a wooden case from the lintel above the fireplace and opening it to reveal rows of fat cigars that draw childish coos from the party
declining one i watch hardcastle as he offers them around
his smile hides a dreadful eagerness his pleasure in this display a foundation for other matters
he wants something
how is helena i ask tasting my drink
its water
dance doesnt even allow himself the pleasure of alcohol
all of this must be hard on her   i should hope so it was her damn idea to come back snorts hardcastle taking a cigar for himself and closing the box
you know a chap wants to do his best be supportive but dash it all ive barely seen her since we got here
cant get two words out of the woman
if i were a spiritual sort of fellow id think her possessed  matches are passing from hand to hand each man indulging his own cigarlighting ritual
forgoing pettigrews back and forth motion herringtons gentle touches and sutcliffes circular theatrics hardcastle simply lights it shooting me an exasperated glance
a flicker of affection stirs within me the remnants of some stronger emotion reduced to embers
blowing out a long trail of yellow smoke hardcastle settles back in his chair
gentleman i invited you here today because we all have something in common his delivery is stiff rehearsed
we are all being blackmailed by ted stanwin but i have a way to free us if youll hear me out  hes watching each of us for a reaction
pettigrew and herrington remain quiet but the lumpen sutcliffe splutters taking a hasty gulp of his drink
go on peter says pettigrew
i have something on stanwin we can exchange for our freedom  the room is still
pettigrew is on the edge of his seat the cigar quite forgotten in his hands
and why havent you used it already he asks
because were in this together says hardcastle
because its damn risky more like interjects a redfaced sutcliffe
you know what happens if one of us moves against stanwin he releases what he has on each of us dropping us all in the pot
exactly like myersons lot  hes bleeding us dry says hardcastle heatedly
hes bleeding you dry peter says sutcliffe jabbing the table with a thick finger
youre about to make a pile out of ravencourt and you dont want stanwin getting his hands on it  that devils had his hand in my pocket for nearly twenty years exclaims hardcastle flushing a little
how much longer can i be expected to let it go on  he turns his gaze on pettigrew
come now christopher surely youre ready to listen to me
stanwins the reason – storm clouds of embarrassment drift across his grey face – well perhaps elspeth wouldnt have left if  pettigrew sips at his drink offering neither rebuke nor encouragement
only i can see the heat rising up his neck or how his fingers are squeezing the glass so tightly the skin behind his nails has turned white
hardcastle hurriedly turns his attention towards me
we can rip stanwins hand from our throat but we need to confront him together he says striking a balled fist into his palm
only by showing that were all ready to act against him will he listen  sutcliffe puffs up
thats  quiet philip interrupts herrington the naval officers eyes never leaving hardcastles
what have you got on stanwin  hardcastle flicks a suspicious glance at the door before lowering his voice
he has a child squirrelled away somewhere he says
hes kept her hidden for fear she may be used against him but daniel coleridge claims to have uncovered her name  the gambler says pettigrew
hows he mixed up in all of this  didnt seem prudent to ask old chap says hardcastle swirling his drink
some men walk in dark places the rest of us shouldnt tread  word has it he pays half the servants in london for information on their masters says herrington pulling his lip
i wouldnt be surprised if the same was true of blackheath and stanwin certainly worked here long enough to have let a secret slip
there could be something in this you know  hearing them discuss daniel gives me an odd tingle of excitement
ive known for some time hes my final host but hes been operating so far in my future ive never truly felt connected to him
to see our investigations converging this way is like catching sight of something long sought on the horizon
finally theres a road between us
hardcastles on his feet warming his hands by the heat of the fire
lit by the flames its clear the years have taken more from him than theyve given
uncertainty is a crack through the centre of him undermining any suggestion of solidity or strength
this mans been broken in two and put back together crooked and if i had to guess id say there was a childshaped hole right in the middle
what does coleridge want from us i ask
hardcastle looks at me with flat unseeing eyes
im sorry he says
you said daniel coleridge has something on stanwin which means he wants something from us in exchange for it
i assume thats why youve called us all together  just so says hardcastle fingering a loose button on his jacket
he wants a favour  only one asks pettigrew
from each of us with the promise that well honour it whenever he calls upon us no matter what it might be  glances are exchanged doubt handed from face to face
i feel like a spy in the enemy camp
im not certain what daniels up to but im obviously meant to help sway this argument in his favour
in my favour
whatever this favour turns out to be hopefully it will help free us and anna from this dreadful place
im for it i say grandly
stanwins comeuppance is long overdue  i concur says pettigrew waving cigar smoke from his face
his hand has been around my neck for far too long already
what about you clifford  i agree says the old sailor
all heads turn to sutcliffe whose eyes are running circuits of the room
were trading devils says the shaggy lawyer eventually
perhaps says hardcastle but ive read my dante philip
not all hells are created equal
now what do you say  he nods grudgingly eyes lowered to his glass
good says hardcastle
ill meet with coleridge and well confront stanwin before dinner
all being well this will be over by the time we announce the wedding  and just like that we climb out of one pocket and into another says pettigrew finishing off his drink
how splendid it is to be a gentleman      35   our business settled sutcliffe pettigrew and herrington trail out of the sitting room in a long curl of cigar smoke as peter hardcastle walks over to the gramophone on the sideboard
wiping the dust from a record with a cotton handkerchief he lowers the needle and flicks a switch brahms blowing out through the flared bronze tube
motioning to the others to go on without me i close the door to the hallway
peters taken a seat by the fire a window opened on his thoughts
hes yet to notice ive stayed behind and it feels as though some great chasm divides us though in truth hes only a step or two away
dances reticence in this matter is paralysing
as a man who despises interruption he is equally wary of disturbing others and the personal nature of the questions i must ask is only compounding the problem
im mired in my hosts manners
two days ago this wouldnt have been an obstacle but every host is stronger than the last and fighting dance is like trying to walk into a gale
decorum allows a polite cough hardcastle turning in his seat to find me by the door
ah dance old man he says
did you forget something  i was hoping we could talk privately  is there some problem with the contract he says warily
i must admit i was worried sutcliffes drinking might  its not sutcliffe its evelyn i say
evelyn he says wariness replaced by weariness
yes of course
come sit by the fire this damned house is draughty enough without inviting its chill  giving me time to settle myself he hitches his trouser leg dancing a foot before the flames
whatever his faults his manners are meticulous
so he says after a moment judging the rigours of etiquette to have been adequately obeyed
whats this about evelyn
i assume she doesnt want to go through with the wedding  finding no easy way of framing the matter i decide to simply toss it into his lap
im afraid its more serious than that i say
somebodys set their mind to murdering your daughter  murder  he frowns smiling a little waiting for the rest of the joke to present itself
undone by my sincerity he leans forward confusion wrinkling his face
youre serious he says hands clasped
i am  do you know who or why  only how
shes being compelled to commit suicide otherwise somebody she loves will be murdered
the information was relayed in a letter  a letter he scoffs
sounds damn iffy to me
probably just a game
you know how these girls can be  its not a game peter i say sternly knocking the doubt from his face
may i ask how you came by this information  the same way i come by all my information i listen  he sighs pinching his nose weighing the facts and the man bringing them to him
do you believe somebodys trying to sabotage our deal with ravencourt he asks
i hadnt considered it i say startled by his response
id expected him to be concerned for his daughters wellbeing perhaps spurred into making plans to ensure her safety
but evelyns incidental
the only loss he fears is that of his fortune
can you think of anybody whose interests would be served by evelyns death i say struggling to contain my sudden distaste for this man
one makes enemies old families whod happily see us ruined but none of them would resort to this
whispers are more their thing gossip at parties spiteful comments in the times you know how it is  he raps the arm of the chair in frustration
dash it all dance are you sure about this
it seems so outlandish  im certain and truth be told my suspicions lie a little closer to home i say
one of the servants he asks lowering his voice his gaze leaping to the door
helena i say
his wifes name strikes him like a blow
helena you must be
i mean my dear man  his face is turning red his words boiling over and spilling out of his mouth
i can feel a similar heat in my own cheeks
this line of questioning is poison to dance
evelyn suggested the relationship was fractured i say quickly laying the words down like stones across a boggy field
hardcastles gone to the window where hes standing with his back to me
civility clearly does not allow for confrontation though i can see his body trembling his hands clenched behind him
i wont deny helena has no great fondness for evelyn but without her well be bankrupt in a couple of years he says measuring every word as he struggles to keep his anger in check
she wouldnt put our future in jeopardy  he didnt say shes not capable of it
but  damn it dance whats your interest in this slander he shouts yelling at my reflection in the glass so he doesnt have to yell at me
this is it
dance knows peter hardcastle well enough to know hes at the end of his patience
my next answer will decide whether he opens up or points me towards the door
i need to choose my words carefully which means pressing the thing he most cares about
either i tell him im trying to save his daughters life or  im sorry peter i say my voice conciliatory
if somebodys trying to sabotage this deal with ravencourt i must put a stop to it both as your friend and your legal counsel  he sags
of course you must he says looking at me over his shoulder
im sorry old friend its just all this talk of murder well its stirring some old memories you understand
naturally if you think evelyns in danger ill do everything i can to help but youre mistaken if you believe helena would ever harm evelyn
the relationship is strained but they do love one another
im certain of it  i allow myself a small sigh of relief
battling dance has been exhausting but finally im on the verge of some answers
your daughter contacted somebody called felicity maddox claiming she was worried by helenas behaviour i continue obliging my hosts need to place the facts in their proper order
shes not on the guest list but i believe felicity came to the house to help and theres a possibility shes now being held as collateral should evelyn fail to go through with the suicide
michael told me she was a childhood friend of your daughters but couldnt recall anything more about her
do you remember this girl
have you seen her around the house perhaps
i have reason to believe she was at liberty this morning  hardcastle looks bewildered
i dont though i must confess evelyn and i havent spoken much since her return
the circumstances of her arrival the marriage theyve put a barrier between us
its peculiar michael wasnt able to tell you more though
theyve been inseparable since she came back and i know he visited often and wrote frequently while evelyn was in paris
i would expect him to know this felicity if anybody does  ill talk to him again but the letter was correct was it not
helena has been acting oddly  the record catches on the gramophone the soaring violin solo yanked back to earth over and over again like a kite in a childs overeager hands
peter glances at it frowning hoping his dissatisfaction alone will right it
defeated he moves to the gramophone lifting the needle blowing dust from the record and holding it up to the light
its scratched he says with a shake of the head
he replaces the record new music taking flight
tell me about helena i nudge
it was her idea to announce the engagement on the anniversary of thomass death and throw the party in blackheath wasnt it  shes never forgiven evelyn for abandoning thomas that morning he says watching the record spin
i confess i thought the years might dull her pain but – he spreads his arms – all this its so he breathes deeply composing himself
helena means to embarrass evelyn i admit
she calls the marriage a punishment but its a rather fine match if you look at the details
ravencourt wont lay a finger on evelyn told me as much himself
“im too old for all that” is what he said
shell have the run of his homes nice allowance any life she chooses so long as it doesnt embarrass him
in return hell get well you know the rumours about his valets
goodlooking chaps coming and going at all hours
scandalmongering is all it is but the marriage will put a stop to it he pauses his stare defiant
you see dance
why would helena arrange all of this if she meant to kill evelyn
she wouldnt she couldnt
beneath it all she loves evelyn
not well i admit but well enough
she needs to feel as if evelyn has been thoroughly punished and then shell start making it up to her
youll see
helena will come around and evelyn will realise this marriage is a blessing in disguise
believe me youre barking up the wrong tree  i still need to speak with your wife peter  my organisers in the drawer it has her appointments in it he laughs grimly
our marriage is one of overlapping duties these days but it should tell you where to find her  i rush to the drawer unable to contain my excitement
somebody in the house possibly helena herself tore these appointments from her dayplanner to conceal her activities
whoever did it either forgot or didnt know that her husband kept his own copy and now theyre in my hands
here and now we might finally discover what was worth all the trouble
the drawer is stiff swollen with damp
it comes open grudgingly revealing a moleskin book held fast with string
flipping through the pages i quickly find helenas appointments my ebullience draining out of me immediately
most of them i already know about
helena met with cunningham at 730 am though theres no indication why
after that she arranged to see evelyn at 815 am and millicent derby at 9 am both of which she missed
she has a meeting with the stablemaster at 1130 am which is in an hours time and then shes expected in ravencourts parlour early this afternoon
she wont attend
my finger roams the schedule searching for something suspicious
evelyn and ravencourt i know about and millicent was an old friend so thats understandable but what could be so urgent shed need to see her husbands bastard son first thing in the morning
he refused to tell me when i asked but hes the only person whos seen helena hardcastle today which means i can no longer tolerate his evasions
i must have the truth out of him
before that i need to visit the stables
for the first time i know where the elusive lady of the house is going to be
do you know why helena met charles cunningham this morning i ask peter as i replace the organiser in the drawer
likely helena wanted to say hello he says pouring himself another drink
she was always close to the boy  is charles cunningham the reason stanwins blackmailing you i ask
does stanwin know hes your son  come now dance he says glaring at me
i meet his gaze my hosts too
dance is slipping apologies onto my tongue urging me to flee the room
its a bloody nuisance
every time i open my mouth to speak i have to force aside another mans embarrassment first
you know me peter so you know what it takes for me to ask such a thing i say
i must have all the pieces of this nasty business to hand  he considers this returning to the window with his drink
not that theres much to see
the trees have grown so close to the house the branches are pressed right up against the glass
judging by peters demeanour hed invite them inside now if he could
charles cunninghams parentage isnt why im being blackmailed he says
that nugget of scandal was on every society page at one time helena made sure of it
theres no money in it  then what is it stanwin knows  i need your word it wont go any further he says
of course i say my pulse quickening
well – he takes a fortifying sip of his drink – before thomas was murdered helena was having an affair with charlie carver  the man who murdered thomas i exclaim sitting a little straighter in my chair
they call this sort of thing cuckolding dont they he says standing stiff at the window
in my case its an unusually perfect metaphor
he took my son from me and left his own child in my nest instead  his own child  cunningham isnt my illegitimate child dance
hes my wifes
charlie carver was his father  that blackguard i exclaim temporarily losing control of dance whose outrage mirrors my shock
how on earth did this happen  carver and helena loved each other he says ruefully
our marriage was never
i had the name helenas family had the money
it was convenient necessary one might say but there was no affection
carver and helena grew up together his father was the gamekeeper on her familys estate
she kept their relationship from me but brought carver to blackheath when we married
im sorry to say my indiscretions got back to her our marriage faltered and a year or so later she fell into carvers bed becoming pregnant soon after  but you didnt raise cunningham as your own  no she led me to believe it was mine during the pregnancy but couldnt be certain herself who the real father was as id continued to well a mans needs are you understand  i believe i do i say coldly remembering the love and respect that governed dances marriage for so long
anyway i was out hunting when cunningham was born so she had the midwife smuggle him out of the house to be nursed in the village
when i returned i was told the child died during the delivery but six months later when she was certain he didnt look too much like carver the baby turned up on our doorstep carried by some wench id had the misfortune to spend time with in london who was happy enough to take my wifes money and pretend it was mine
helena played the victim insisting we take the boy in and to my shame i agreed
we handed the child to the cook mrs drudge who raised him as her own
believe it or not we actually managed to find several peaceful years after that
evelyn thomas and michael were born in short order and for a while we were a happy family  all through the story ive watched his face for some emotion but its been a bland recital of the facts
once again im struck by the callowness of this man
an hour ago id assumed thomass death had reduced his feelings to ash but now i wonder if that soil wasnt always infertile
nothing grows in this man but greed
how did you discover the truth i ask
sheer chance he says laying his hands against the wall either side of the window
i went for a walk and stumbled upon carver and helena arguing over the boys future
she admitted everything  so why not divorce her i ask
and have everybody know my shame he says aghast
bastard children are common currency these days but imagine the tattle if people discovered lord peter hardcastle had been cuckolded by a common gardener
no dance that wouldnt do  what happened after you found out  i let carver go gave him a day to get off the estate  was that the same day he killed thomas  exactly so our confrontation sent him into a rage and he he  his eyes are blurry red with drink
hes been emptying and refilling that glass all morning
stanwin came to helena a few months later with his hand out
you see dance im not being blackmailed directly
its helena and my reputation with her
i simply pay for it  and what of michael evelyn and cunningham i ask
do they know any of this  not to my knowledge
a secrets hard enough to keep without putting it in the mouths of children  so how did stanwin come by it  ive been asking myself that question for nineteen years and im no closer to an answer
perhaps he was friends with carver servants talk after all
otherwise im at a loss
all i know is that should word get out ill be ruined
ravencourts sensitive to scandal and he wont marry into a family on the front pages  his voice lowers drunk and mean his finger pointed directly at me
keep evelyn alive and ill give you anything you ask you hear me
i wont let that bitch cost me my fortune dance
i wont allow it      36   peter hardcastle has fallen into a drunken sulk gripping his glass as though worried somebody will take it from him
judging his usefulness at an end i grab an apple from the fruit bowl and slip out of the room on the end of a hollow apology closing the sittingroom door that i might ascend the stairs without his noticing
i need to speak with gold and id rather not wade through a cloud of questions to do so
a draught greets me at the top of the staircase twisting and curling in the air sneaking through the cracked windows and beneath the doors to stir the leaves littering the floor
im reminded of walking these corridors as sebastian bell searching for the butler with evelyn at my side
its odd to think of them here odder still to remember that bell and i are the same man
his cowardice makes me cringe but theres enough distance between us now that it sits apart from me
he feels like an embarrassing story i once overheard at a party
somebody elses shame
dance despises men such as bell but i cant be so judgemental
i have no idea who i am beyond blackheath or how i think when im not wedged inside somebody elses mind
for all i know im exactly like bell and would that truly be so bad
i envy him his compassion as i envy ravencourts intelligence and dances ability to see through the shroud to the heart of things
if i carry any of these qualities out of blackheath ill be proud to have them
making certain im alone in the corridor i enter the room where gregory gold is hanging from the ceiling by his bound wrists
hes murmuring jerking in pain trying to outrun some untiring nightmare
compassion compels me to cut him down but anna wouldnt have left him strung up like this without a very good reason
even so i still need to speak with him so i shake him gently then more firmly
nothing
i slap his face then splash him with water from the nearby jug but he doesnt stir
this is horrendous
doctor dickies sedative is unyielding and no matter how hard gold writhes he cant free himself of it
my stomach turns a chill settling on my bones
until now the horrors in my future had always been vague insubstantial things dark shapes lurking in a fog
but this is me my fate
reaching up on my tiptoes i pull his sleeves down to reveal the slashes on his arms he showed me last night
dont get out of the carriage i murmur recalling his warning
step away from him says anna from behind me
and turn around nice and slow
i wont ask twice  i do as she bids
she is standing in the doorway with a shotgun pointed at me
blonde hair spills from her cap her expression fierce
her aim is steady her finger pressing against the trigger
one wrong move and i have no doubt shed kill me to protect gold
no matter the odds arrayed against me knowing somebody cares this deeply is enough to make even dances cold heart swell
its me anna i say
its aiden  aiden  the shotgun lowers a little as she steps close her face breathing distance from my own as she inspects my newly acquired crags and lines
the book mentioned youd get old she says holding the gun in one hand
didnt mention youd end up with a face like a headstone though  she nods at gold
admiring the slashes are you she says
doctor reckons he did that to himself
poor man cut his own arms to ribbons  why i ask horrified trying to imagine any circumstance in which id turn a knife on myself
youd know better than me she sniffs
lets talk where its warm  i follow her into the room across the corridor where the butlers sleeping peacefully beneath white cotton sheets
light is pouring through a high window and a small fire is crackling in the grate
dried blood mars the pillow but otherwise its a serene scene affectionate and intimate
has he woken up yet i say nodding to the butler
briefly in the carriage
we havent long arrived
poor sod could barely breathe
what about dance
whats he like asks anna hiding the shotgun under the bed
humourless hates his son otherwise hes fine
anythings better than jonathan derby i say pouring myself a glass of water from the jug on the table
i met him this morning she says distantly
cant imagine its pleasant being trapped in that head  it wasnt
i say tossing her the apple i took from the sitting room you told him you were hungry so i brought you this
i wasnt sure if youd had a chance to eat yet  i havent she says polishing it on her apron
ta  i walk over to the window clearing a spot of grime away with my sleeve
it looks out over the road where im surprised to see the plague doctor pointing at the gatehouse
daniels standing beside him the two of them conferring
the scene unsettles me
thus far my interlocutor has taken great care to keep a barrier between us
this closeness i see now feels like collaboration as though ive bowed to blackheath in some way accepting evelyns death and the plague doctors assertion that only one of us can leave
nothing could be further from the truth
knowing i can change this day has given me the belief to keep fighting so what on earth are they talking about down there
what can you see says anna
the plague doctor talking with daniel i say
i havent met him she says taking a bite out of her apple
and what the bloody hell is a plague doctor  i blink at her
meeting you in the wrong orders becoming problematic  at least theres only one of me she says
tell me about this doctor of yours  i quickly fill her in on my history with the plague doctor starting with our meeting in the study when i was sebastian bell and recounting how he stopped my car when i tried to escape and more recently upbraided me for chasing madeline aubert in the forest as jonathan derby
it already seems a lifetime ago
sounds like youve made a friend she says chewing noisily
hes using me i say
i just dont know what for  daniel might they seem chummy enough she says joining me at the window
any idea what theyre talking about
have you solved evelyns murder and forgotten to tell me  if we do this right there wont be a murder to solve i say my attention fixed on the scene below
so youre still trying to save her even after the plague doctor said it was almost impossible  as a rule i ignore half of everything he tells me i say distantly
call it a healthy scepticism of any wisdom that comes delivered through a mask
besides i know this day can be changed ive seen it  christs sake aiden she says angrily
whats wrong i ask startled
this all of this she says spreading her arms exasperatedly
we had a deal you and me
id sit in this little room and keep these two safe and youd use your eight lives to solve this murder  thats what im doing i say confused by her anger
no its not she says
youre running around trying to save the person whose death is our best chance of escape  shes my friend anna  shes bells friend anna counters
she humiliated ravencourt and she nearly killed derby
far as ive seen theres more warmth in a long winter than in that woman  she had her reasons  its a weak response intended to bat away the question rather than answer it
annas right evelyn hasnt been my friend for a long time now and though the memory of her kindness still lingers its not my driving impulse
thats something else something deeper something squirming
the idea of leaving her to be slain sickens me
not dance not any of my other hosts
it sickens me aiden bishop
unfortunately annas building up a head of steam and doesnt give me a chance to dwell on the revelation
i dont care about her reasons i care about yours she says pointing at me
maybe you dont feel it but deep down i know how long ive been in this place
its decades aiden im sure of it
i need to leave i have to and this is my best chance with you
youve got eight lives youll get out of here eventually
i do all this once and then forget
without you im stuck and what happens if next time you wake up as bell you dont remember me  i wont leave you here anna i insist shaken by the desperation in her voice
then solve the damn murder like the plague doctor asked you to and believe him when he says that evelyn cant be saved  i cant trust him i say losing my temper and turning my back on her
why not everything hes said has happened
hes  he said youd betray me i shout
what  he told me youd betray me i repeat shaken by the admission
until now id never actually voiced the accusation preferring to dismiss it in the quiet of my thoughts
now ive said it out loud its a real possibility and it worries me
annas right everything else the plague doctors said has come true and as strong as my connection to this woman is i cant be completely certain she wont turn on me
she reels backwards as if struck shaking her head
id never aiden id never do that i swear  he said you remembered more about our last loop than you were admitting i say
is that true
is there something youre not telling me  she hesitates
is it true anna i demand
no she says forcefully
hes trying to get between us aiden
i dont know why but you cant listen to him  thats my point i shoot back
if the plague doctors telling the truth about evelyn hes telling the truth about you
i dont believe he is
i think he wants something something we dont know about and i think hes using us to get it  even if thats the case i dont understand why youre so insistent on saving evelyn says anna still struggling with what i had told her
because somebodys going to kill her i say haltingly
and theyre not doing it themselves theyre twisting her in knots so shell do it herself and theyre making sure everybody sees
its cruel and theyre enjoying it and i cant
it doesnt matter whether we like her or whether the plague doctor is right you dont get to kill somebody and put them on display
shes innocent and we can stop it
and we should  i falter breathless teetering on the edge of a memory sprung loose by annas questions
its as though a curtains been pulled back the man i used to be almost visible through the gap
guilt and grief theyre the keys im certain of it
theyre what brought me to blackheath in the first place
theyve been driving me to save evelyn but that wasnt my purpose here not really
there was somebody else i say slowly clutching at the edges of the memory
a woman i think
shes the reason i came here but i couldnt save her  what was her name says anna taking my wrinkled old hands and looking up into my face
i cant remember i say my head throbbing in concentration
was it me  i dont know i say
the memorys slipping away
there are tears on my cheeks an ache in my chest
i feel like ive lost somebody but i have no idea who
i look into annas wide brown eyes
its gone i say weakly
im sorry aiden  dont be i say feeling my strength return
were going to get out of blackheath i promise but i have to do it my way
ill make it work you just have to trust me anna  im expecting an objection but she confounds me with a smile
then where do we start she says
im going to find helena hardcastle i say wiping my face with a handkerchief
do you have any leads on the footman
he killed derby last night and i doubt dance is far behind  actually ive been thinking up a plan  she peers under the bed bringing out the artists sketchbook which she opens and drops on my lap
this is the book thats been guiding her all day but the intricate spiderweb of cause and effect id anticipated is nowhere to be seen
its contents are gibberish as far as i can tell
i thought i wasnt allowed to see this i say craning my head to read her awkward upsidedown writing
im honoured  dont be im only letting you see the bit you need she says
circled warnings and sketches of the days events have been scrawled in an erratic hand snatches of conversation dashed onto the page without any context to explain them
i recognise a few of the moments including a hasty drawing of the butlers beating at the hands of gold but most of them are meaningless
its only after ive been assaulted by the chaos that i begin to see annas attempt to bring order
using a pencil shes diligently written notes for herself near the entries
guesses have been made times noted down our conversations recorded and crossreferenced with those in the book teasing out the useful information contained within
i doubt youll be able to do much with it says anna watching me struggle
one of your hosts gave it to me
might as well be written in another language
a lot of it doesnt make any sense but ive been adding to it using it to keep track of your comings and goings
this is everything i know about you
every host everything theyve done
its the only way i can keep up but its not complete
there are holes
thats why i need you to show me the best time to approach bell  bell why  this footman is looking for me so were going to tell him exactly where ill be she says writing a note on a loose piece of paper
well gather some of your other hosts and be waiting for him when he gets his knife out  and how are we going to trap him i say
with this – she hands me the note
if you tell me about bells day i can make sure to put it somewhere hell find it
once i mention it in the kitchen the meeting will be up and down the house in an hour
the footmans sure to hear of it  dont leave blackheath more lives than your own are depending on you
meet me by the mausoleum in the family graveyard at 1020 pm and ill explain everything
love anna  im transported back to that evening when evelyn and bell stalked into the dank graveyard revolver in hand finding only shadows and a shattered compass covered in blood
as omens go its not reassuring but its not definitive either
its another piece of the future come loose from the whole and until i get there ill have no idea what it means
annas waiting for my reaction but my unease isnt sufficient reason for objection
have you seen how this ends does it work she asks fingering the hem of her sleeve nervously
i dont know but its the best plan we have i say
were going to need help and youre running short of hosts  dont worry ill find it  i pull a fountain pen from my pocket adding one more line to the message something to spare poor bell a great deal of frustration
oh and dont forget your gloves theyre burning
37   i hear the horses before i see them dozens of shoes clopping along the cobblestones ahead of me
not far behind is their smell a musty odour mingled with the stench of manure a thick rolling mix even the wind cant disturb
only after ive been assaulted by their impression do i finally come upon the animals themselves thirty or so being led out of the stables and up the main road towards the village carriages harnessed to their backs
stable hands are guiding them on foot their uniform flat caps white shirts and loose grey trousers rendering them as indistinguishable from each other as the horses in their care
im watching the hooves nervously
in a flash of memory i recall being thrown from a horse as a boy the beasts hooves catching me in the chest my bones cracking  dont let dance get a grip on you
i tear myself free of my hosts memories lowering the hand which had instinctively gone to the scar on my chest
its getting worse
bells personality rarely surfaced at all but between derbys lust and dances manners and childhood traumas its becoming difficult to keep a straight course
a few horses in the middle of the mass are nipping at those to the side of them a ripple of agitation passing through the muscular brown tide
its enough for me to take an illadvised step off the road straight into a pile of manure
im flicking the filth free when one of the stable hands peels away from the pack
something i can help you with mr dance he says tipping his cap at me
you know me i say surprised by this recognition
sorry sir names oswald sir i saddled the stallion you rode yesterday
fine thing sir seeing a gentleman on a horse
not many know how to ride that way any more  he smiles showing off two rows of gappy teeth stained brown with tobacco
of course of course i say the passing horses nudging him in the back
actually oswald i was looking for lady hardcastle
she was supposed to be meeting alf miller the stablemaster  not sure bout her ladyship sir but youve just missed alf
left with somebody about ten minutes gone
heading to the lake best i could tell took the path alongside the paddock
its on your right as you pass under the arch sir you can probably still catch them if you hurry  thank you oswald  of course sir  tipping his cap again he falls in with the pack
keeping to the edge of the road i carry on towards the stables the loose cobbles slowing me down considerably
in my other hosts i simply leapt aside when one slid beneath me
dances old legs arent nimble enough for that and every time one wobbles under my weight it twists my ankles and knees threating to tip me over
vexed i pass beneath the arch to find oats hay and smashed fruit littering the courtyard a boy doing his best to sweep the debris into the corners
hed probably have more luck if he wasnt half the size of the brush
he peeks at me shyly as i pass trying to doff his cap but only succeeding in losing it to the wind
the last i see of him hes chasing it across the yard as though all his dreams were stuffed inside
the path nestled alongside the paddock is little more than a muddy trail rotten with puddles and my trousers are already filthy by the time im halfway along
twigs are cracking rain dripping from the plants
i have the sense of being watched and though theres nothing to suggest its anything more than nerves i swear i can feel a presence among the trees a pair of eyes dogging my steps
i can only hope im mistaken because if the footman does spring onto the path im too weak to fight and too slow to run
the rest of my life will be precisely how long it takes him to pick a way of killing me
seeing no sign of the stablemaster or lady hardcastle i sacrifice my deportment completely splattering mud up my back as i break into a worried trot
the trail soon veers away from the paddock and into the forest that sense of being watched only growing as i move further away from the stables
brambles snatch at my clothes as i push through until finally i hear the murmur of approaching voices and the lapping of water against the shore
relief overwhelms me and i realise ive been holding my breath this entire time
were face to face in two steps though its not lady hardcastle i find accompanying the stablemaster but rather cunningham ravencourts valet
hes wearing a thick coat and the long purple scarf hell struggle to tug loose when he interrupts ravencourt speaking with daniel
the banker must be asleep in the library
their alarm at bumping into me suggests they were discussing far more than mere gossip
its cunningham who recovers first smiling amiably
mr dance what a pleasant surprise he says
what brings you out on this foul morning  i was looking for helena hardcastle i say glancing from cunningham to the stablemaster
i was under the impression she was taking a walk with mr miller here  no sir says miller kneading his cap between his hands
supposed to be meeting at my cottage sir
im on my way there now  we three find ourselves in the same boat then says cunningham
i was also hoping to catch her
perhaps we can go along together
my business shouldnt take very long but ill be happy to stand in line as it were  and what is your business i ask as we begin walking back towards the stables
it was my understanding you met with lady hardcastle before breakfast  the directness of my question momentarily unsettles his good cheer a flash of annoyance passing across his face
a few matters for lord hardcastle he says
you know how these things are
one mess soon leads to another  but you have seen the lady of the house today i say
indeed first thing  how did she seem  he shrugs frowning at me
i couldnt say
our talk was very brief
may i ask where these questions are leading mr dance
i rather feel like im facing you in court  nobody else has seen lady hardcastle today
that strikes me as strange  perhaps shes wary of being pestered with questions he says flaring
we arrive at the stablemasters cottage in an irritated mood mr miller writhing in discomfort as he invites us inside
its as neat and orderly as the last time i was here although much too small for three men and their secrets
i take the chair by the table while cunningham inspects the bookcase and the stablemaster frets doing his best to tidy an already tidy cottage
we wait for ten minutes but lady hardcastle never arrives
its cunningham who breaks the silence
well it seems the lady has other plans he says checking his watch
id better get off im expected in the library
good morning to you mr dance mr miller he says inclining his head before opening the door and departing
miller looks up at me nervously
what about you mr dance he says
will you be waiting longer  i ignore this and join him by the fireplace
what were you speaking with cunningham about i ask
he stares at the window as though his answers are coming by messenger
i snap my fingers in front of his face drawing his watery eyes towards me
at this moment im simply curious mr miller i say in a low voice dripping with unpleasant possibilities
in a minute or so ill be annoyed
tell me what you were speaking about  he wanted somebody to show him around he says jutting out his lower lip revealing the pink flesh within
wanted to see the lake he did  whatever millers skills in this world lying is not one of them
his elderly face is a mass of wrinkles and overhanging flesh more than enough material for his emotions to build a stage from
every frown is a tragedy every smile a farce
a lie sitting as it does somewhere between both is enough to collapse the entire performance
placing my hand on his shoulder i lower my face to his watching as his eyes flee mine
charles cunningham grew up on this estate mr miller as well you know
he has no need of a tour guide
now what were you discussing  he shakes his head
i promised  i can make promises too miller but you wont enjoy mine  my fingers press into his collarbone tight enough to make him wince
he was asking about the murdered boy he says reluctantly
thomas hardcastle  no sir the other one  what other one  keith parker the stable boy  what stable boy
what are you talking about man  nobody remembers him sir not important enough he says gritting his teeth
one of mine he was
lovely boy about fourteen
went missing a week or so before master thomas died
couple of peelers came up to take a look in the forest but they couldnt find his body so they said he ran away
i tell you sir he never did
loved his mam loved his job
he wouldnt have done it
i said as much at the time but nobody listened  did they ever find him  no sir never did  and thats what you told cunningham  aye sir  is that all you told him  his eyes shift left and right
theres more isnt there i say
no sir  dont lie to me miller i say coldly my hackles rising
dance hates people who try to deceive him considering it a suggestion of gullibility of stupidity
to even attempt it liars must believe themselves to be cleverer than the person theyre lying to an assumption he finds grotesquely insulting
im not lying sir protests the poor stablemaster a vein bulging on his forehead
you are
tell me what you know i demand
i cant  you will or ill ruin you mr miller i say giving my host free rein
ill take everything you have every stitch of clothing and every penny youve squirrelled away  dances words pour out of my mouth each one dripping with poison
this is how he runs his law practice bludgeoning his opponents with threats and intimidation
in his own way dance may be just as vile as derby
ill dig up every  the storys a lie miller blurts out
his face is ashen his eyes haunted
what does that mean
out with it i say
they say charlie carver killed master thomas sir  what of it  well he couldnt have sir
charlie and me were friendly like
charlie had an argument with lord hardcastle that morning been fired he had so he decided to take severance  severance  a few bottles of brandy sir right out of lord hardcastles study
just walked in and took them  so he stole a few bottles of brandy i say
how does that prove his innocence  he came to fetch me after i sent miss evelyn out riding on her pony
wanted a last drink with a friend he said
couldnt say no could i
we drank those bottles between us me and charlie but around half an hour before the murder he said i had to leave  leave why  he said somebody was coming to see him  who  i dont know sir he never said
he just  he falters feeling along the edge of the answer for the crack hes certain hes about to fall through
what i demand
the poor fools wringing his hands together rucking up the rug with the ball of his left foot
he said everything was arranged sir said they were going to help him get a good position somewhere else
i thought maybe  yes  the way he was talking sir
i thought  spit it out for gods sake miller  lady hardcastle sir he says meeting my gaze for the first time
i thought maybe he was meeting lady helena hardcastle
theyd always been friendly like  my hand drops from his shoulder
but you didnt see her arrive  i  you didnt leave did you i say catching the guilt on his face
you wanted to see who was coming so you hid somewhere nearby  for a minute sir just to see to make sure he was all right  why didnt you tell anybody this i say frowning at him
i was told not to sir  by whom  he looks up at me chewing the silence into a desperate plea
by whom dammit i persist
well lady hardcastle sir
thats what made me well she wouldnt have let charlie kill her son would she
and if he had she wouldnt have told me to keep it quiet
doesnt make no sense does it
he has to be innocent  and you kept this secret all these years  i was afraid sir
terrible afraid sir  of helena hardcastle  of the knife sir
the one used to kill thomas
they found it in carvers cabin hidden under the floorboards
thats what did for him in the end sir  why would you be afraid of the knife miller  because it was mine sir
horseshoe knife it was
went missing from my cottage a couple of days before the murder
that and a nice blanket right off my bed
i thought they might well blame me sir
like i was in on it with carver sir  the next few minutes pass in a blur my thoughts far afield
im vaguely aware of promising to keep millers secrets just as im vaguely aware of leaving the cottage the rain soaking me as i head back towards the house
michael hardcastle told me somebody had been with charlie carver the morning of thomass death somebody stanwin had clipped with a shotgun before they escaped
could that person have been lady hardcastle
if so her injuries would have needed tending quietly
doctor dickie
the hardcastles were hosting a party the weekend thomas was murdered and by evelyns account the same guests were invited back for this ball
dickies in the house today so its likely he was here nineteen years ago
he wont talk hes loyal as a dog
hes in the drugpeddling business with bell i say remembering the markedup bible i found in his room when i was derby
that will be enough leverage to force the truth from him  my excitements building
if dickie confirms that lady hardcastle was shot in the shoulder shed have to be a suspect in thomass death
but why on earth would she take her own sons life or allow carver – a man lord hardcastle claimed she loved – to take the blame on her behalf
this is the closest dance gets to glee the old lawyer having spent his life following the facts like a hunting dog with the scent of blood in its nose and its not until blackheath lifts itself off the horizon that i finally awake to my surroundings
at this distance with these weak eyes the house is smudged the cracks obscured and one sees blackheath as it must formerly have been back when a young millicent derby summered here with ravencourt and the hardcastles when children played in the forest without fear their parents enjoying parties and music laughter and singing
how glorious it must have been
one could understand why helena hardcastle might yearn for those days again and might even attempt to restore them by throwing another party
one could understand but only a fool would accept that as the reason any of this is happening
blackheath cannot be restored
the murder of thomas hardcastle hollowed it out forever making it fit only for ruin and yet despite that shes invited the same guests to the same party nineteen years later to the day
the past has been dug up and dressed up but to what purpose
if millers right and charlie carver didnt kill thomas hardcastle chances are it was helena hardcastle the spinner of this dreadful web were all tangled in and the woman im increasingly convinced is at the centre of it
chances are shes planning to kill evelyn tonight and i still dont have any idea how to find her let alone stop her
38   a few gentlemen are smoking outside blackheath sharing stories of last nights debauchery
their cheerful greetings follow me up the steps but i pass by without comment
my legs are aching my lower back demanding a soak in the bathtub but i dont have time
the hunt begins in half an hour and i cant miss it
i have too many questions and most of the answers will be carrying shotguns
taking a decanter of scotch from the drawing room i retire to my room knocking back a couple of stiff drinks to smother the pain
i can feel dances objection his distaste not only at my acknowledgement of the discomfort but my need to dim it
my host despises whats happening to him seeing age as a malignancy a consumption and an erosion
stripping out of my muddy clothes i take myself over to the mirror realising i still have no idea what dance looks like
putting on a new body every day has already become commonplace and its only the hope of catching some glimpse of the real aiden bishop that compels me to keep looking
dance is in his late seventies as withered and grey on the outside as the inside
almost bald his face is a river of wrinkles running off his skull pinned in place only by a large roman nose
either side of that are a small grey moustache and dark lifeless eyes suggesting nothing of the man within except perhaps that there may not be a man within
anonymity seems to be a compulsion with dance whose clothes – though good quality – come in shades of grey with only the handkerchiefs and bow ties offering anything in the way of colour
even then the choice is either dark red or dark blue giving the impression of a man camouflaged within his own life
his hunting tweeds are a little tight around the middle but theyll suffice and with another glass of scotch warming my throat i cross the corridor to doctor dickies bedroom rapping on the door
steps approach from the other side dickie opening it wide
hes dressed for the hunt
i dont work this much at my surgery he grumbles
i should warn you ive already tended knife wounds memory loss and a severe beating this morning so whatever your ailment it needs to be interesting
and above the waist preferably  you peddle drugs through sebastian bell i say bluntly watching the smile vanish from his face
he sells them you supply them  white as a sheet hes forced to steady himself against the doorframe
seeing weakness i press my advantage
ted stanwin would pay handsomely for this information but i dont need stanwin
i need to know if you treated helena hardcastle or anybody else for a gunshot wound the day thomas hardcastle was murdered  the police asked me the same question at the time and i answered honestly he rasps loosening his collar
no i did not  scowling i turn away from him
im going to stanwin i say
dammit man im telling the truth he says catching my arm
we look each other in the eyes
his are old and dim and lit by fear
whatever he finds in mine causes him to release me immediately
helena hardcastle loves her children more than life itself and she loved thomas the most he insists
she couldnt have harmed him she wouldnt have been able
i swear to you on my honour as a gentleman nobody came to me that day with an injury and i dont have the first clue who stanwin shot  i hold his pleading gaze for a second searching for some flicker of deceit but hes telling the truth im certain of it
deflated i let the doctor go and return to the entrance hall where the rest of the gentlemen are gathering smoking and chatting impatient for the hunt to begin
i was certain dickie would confirm helenas involvement and in so doing give me a starting point for evelyns death
i need to get a better picture of what happened to thomas and i know precisely the man to ask
searching for ted stanwin i step into the drawing room where i find philip sutcliffe in green hunting tweeds attacking the keys of the pianoforte with a great deal of gusto and very little skill the almostmusic transporting me back to my first morning in the house – a memory currently being lived by sebastian bell whos standing alone and uncomfortable in the far corner nursing a drink he doesnt even know the name of
my pity for him is balanced by dances irritation the old lawyer having little patience for ignorance of any sort
given the chance hed tell bell everything consequences be damned and i must admit the idea is tempting
why shouldnt bell know that he saw a maid called madeline aubert in the forest this morning and not anna
and that neither of them died so his guilt is unnecessary
i could explain the loop and how evelyns murder is the key to escape preventing him from wasting his day as donald davies by trying to flee
cunningham is charlie carvers son id say and it looks like hes trying to prove carver didnt kill thomas hardcastle
when the time comes this is the information youll blackmail cunningham with because ravencourt abhors scandal and would almost certainly get rid of his valet if he found out
id tell him to find the mysterious felicity maddox and most importantly helena hardcastle because every road leads back to the missing lady of the house
it wouldnt work
i know i mutter ruefully
bells first thought would be that id escaped from the madhouse and when he finally realised it was all true his investigation would change the day completely
much as i want to help him im too close to my answer to risk unravelling this loop
bell will have to do this alone
an arm catches my elbow christopher pettigrew appearing beside me with a plate in his hand
ive never been this near to him before and if it werent for dances impeccable manners my disgust would be plain on my face
up close he looks like something recently dug up
soon be rid of him says pettigrew nodding over my shoulder towards ted stanwin whos picking at the cold cuts on the dining table while watching his fellow guests through narrowed eyes
his disgust is obvious
until this moment id always taken him for a simple bully but its more than that i see now
his business is blackmail which means he knows every secret and hidden shame every possible scandal and perversity lapping around this house
worse he knows who got away with what
he despises everybody in blackheath including himself for protecting their secrets so he spends every day picking fights to make himself feel better
somebody pushes by me a confused charles cunningham arriving from the library with ravencourts letter in his hand while the maid lucy harper clears away plates oblivious to the events brewing around her
with a pang i realise that she looks a little like my dead wife rebecca
in her younger days of course
theres a similarity of movement a gentleness of action as though  rebecca wasnt your wife
dammit dance i say shaking myself free of him
sorry didnt catch that old man says pettigrew frowning at me
flushing with embarrassment i open my mouth to respond but im distracted by poor lucy harper as she tries to squeeze past stanwin to fetch an empty plate
shes prettier than i recall freckled and blueeyed trying to tuck her wild red hair back under her cap
scuse me ted she says
ted he says angrily grabbing her wrist and squeezing hard enough to make her wince
who the hell do you think youre talking to lucy
its mr stanwin to you im not downstairs with the rats any more  shocked and afraid she searches our faces for help
unlike sebastian bell dance is a keen observer of human nature and watching this scene play out before me im struck by something queer
when i first witnessed this moment id taken note only of lucys fear at being manhandled but she isnt merely afraid shes surprised
upset even
and rather oddly so is stanwin
let her go ted says daniel coleridge from the doorway
the rest of the confrontation goes as i remember stanwin retreating daniel collecting bell and taking him through into the study to meet michael offering me a small nod of acknowledgement along the way
shall we go asks pettigrew
i suspect our entertainment is at an end  im tempted to search for stanwin but i have no desire to climb those stairs and make my way into the east wing when i know for certain hes coming on this hunt
better to wait for him here i decide
shouldering our way through the scandalised throng we pass through the entrance hall and out onto the driveway to find sutcliffe already waiting along with herrington and a couple of other chaps i dont recognise
dark clouds are clambering atop one another pregnant with a storm ive now seen batter blackheath half a dozen times
the hunters are huddled in a pack holding onto their hats and jackets as the wind tugs at them with a thousand thieving hands
only the dogs seem eager straining at their leads and barking into the gloom
its going to be a miserable afternoon and the knowledge that im going to be striding into it only makes things worse
what ho says sutcliffe upon our approach the shoulders of his jacket dusted with dandruff
herrington nods at us trying to scrape something unpleasant off his shoes
did you see daniel coleridges little showdown with stanwin he asks
i think weve backed the right horse after all  well see says sutcliffe darkly
wheres daniel gone anyway  i look around but daniels nowhere to be seen and all i can offer in reply is a shrug
gamekeepers are handing out shotguns to those who havent brought their own including me
mines been polished and oiled the barrels are cracked open to display the two red shells stuffed in the cylinders
the others seem to have some experience with firearms immediately checking the sights by aiming at imaginary targets in the sky but dance does not share their enthusiasm for the pursuit leaving me somewhat at a loss
after watching me fiddle with the shotgun for some minutes the impatient gamekeeper shows me how to settle it across my forearm handing me a box of shells and moving on to the next man
i must admit the gun makes me feel better
all day ive felt eyes upon me and ill be glad of a weapon when the forest surrounds me
no doubt the footmans waiting to catch me alone and ill be damned if im going to make it easy for him
appearing out of nowhere michael hardcastle is by our side blowing warm breaths into his hands
sorry for the delay gentlemen he says
my father sends his apologies but somethings come up
hes asked us to press on ahead without him  and what should we do if we spot bells dead woman asks pettigrew sarcastically
michael scowls at him
a little christian charity please he says
the doctors been through a lot  five bottles at least says sutcliffe bringing guffaws from everybody except michael
catching the younger mans withering look he throws his hands up in the air
oh come michael you saw the state he was in last night
you cant believe were actually going to find anything
nobodys missing the mans raving  bell wouldnt make this up says michael
i saw his arm somebody cut him to ribbons out there  probably fell over his own bottle snorts pettigrew rubbing his hands together for warmth
were interrupted by the gamekeeper who hands michael a black revolver
aside from a long scratch down the barrel its identical to the gun evelyn will carry into the graveyard tonight one of the pair taken from helena hardcastles bedroom
oiled it for you sir says the gamekeeper tipping his cap and moving off
michael slips the weapon into the holster at his waist resuming our conversation quite oblivious to my interest
i dont see why everybodys taking it so hard he continues
this hunts been arranged for days were merely going in a different direction than originally intended thats all
if we spot something very well
if not weve lost nothing in setting the doctors mind at rest  a few expectant glances are cast my way dance usually being the deciding voice in these matters
im spared having to comment by the barking dogs whove been given a little lead by the gamekeepers and are now tugging our company across the lawn towards the forest
looking back towards blackheath i search out bell
hes framed by the study window his body half obscured by the red velvet drapes
in this light at this distance theres something of the spectre about him though in this case i suppose the house is haunting him
the other hunters are already entering the forest the group having fractured into smaller knots by the time i finally catch up
i need to talk to stanwin about helena but hes moving quickly holding himself apart from us
i can barely keep sight of him let alone talk with him and eventually i give up deciding to corner him when we stop to rest
wary of encountering the footman i join sutcliffe and pettigrew who are still pondering the implications of daniels deal with lord hardcastle
their good cheer doesnt last
the forest is oppressive bludgeoning every utterance down to a whisper after an hour and crushing all conversation twenty minutes after that
even the dogs have gone quiet sniffing at the ground as they tug us deeper into the murk
the shotgun is a comforting weight in my arms and i cling to it fiercely tiring quickly but never letting myself fall too far behind the group
enjoy yourself old man daniel coleridge calls out from behind me
im sorry i stir sluggishly from my thoughts
dance is one of the better hosts says daniel drawing closer
good mind calm manner ableenough body  this ableenough body feels like its walked a thousand miles not ten i say hearing the weariness in my voice
michaels arranged for the hunting party to split he says
the older gents will take a breather while the younger lot carry on
dont worry youll have a chance to rest your legs soon  thick bushes have sprung up between us forcing us to carry on our conversation blind like two lovers in a maze
its a damn nuisance being tired all of the time i say seeing glimpses of him through the leaves
im looking forward to coleridges youth  dont let this handsome face of his fool you he muses
coleridges soul is black as pitch
keeping hold of him is exhausting
mark my words when youre wearing this body youll look back on dance with a great deal of fondness so enjoy him while you can  the bushes recede allowing daniel to fall into step beside me
he has a black eye and is walking with a slight limp every step accompanied by a wince of pain
i remember seeing these injuries at dinner but the gentle candlelight made them look far less severe
shock must show on my face because he smiles weakly
its not as bad as it looks he says
what happened  i chased the footman through the passages he says
you went without me i say surprised by his recklessness
when we made the plan to corner the footman beneath the house it was evident that it required six people to be successful a pair to watch each of the three exits
once anna refused to help and derby was knocked unconscious i assumed daniel would drop it
evidently derby isnt the last of my bullheaded hosts
no choice old chap he says
thought i had him
turns out i was mistaken
luckily i managed to fight him off before he loosed his knife  anger sizzles deep in every word
i can only imagine how it must feel to be so preoccupied by the future that youre blindsided by the present
have you found a way to free anna yet i ask
with a painful groan daniel hitches his shotgun up his arm
even limping at my slow pace hes barely able to stand up straight
i havent and i dont think im going to he says
im sorry hard as it is to hear only one of us can leave and the closer we get to 11 pm the more likely it is anna will betray us
we can only trust each other from here on  shell betray you
is this the moment behind the plague doctors warning
friendship is a simple matter when everybody stands to benefit but now how will she react knowing daniels giving up on her
how will you react
sensing my hesitation daniel lays a comforting hand on my shoulder
with a start i realise that dance admires this man
he finds his sense of purpose exhilarating his singlemindedness resonating with a quality my host values in himself
perhaps thats why daniel approached me with this information rather than any of our other hosts
these two are reflections of each other
you didnt tell her did you he says anxiously
about our offer being hollow  i was distracted  i know its difficult but you must keep all of this to yourself says daniel sweeping me into his confidence as one would a child entrusted with a secret
if were to outfox the footman well need annas help
we wont get that if she knows we cant hold up our end of the bargain  heavy steps sound behind us and looking over my shoulder i see michael advancing on us his customary grin replaced by a scowl
heavens says daniel
you look like somebody kicked your dog
what on earths wrong  its this damnable search he says irritably
belly saw a girl murdered out here and yet i cant get a single person to take it seriously
im not asking much just that they look around as they walk
maybe knock over a pile of leaves that sort of thing  daniel coughs shooting michael an embarrassed glance
oh dear says michael frowning at him
this is bad news isnt it  good news really says daniel hastily
theres no dead girl
it was a misunderstanding  a misunderstanding says michael slowly
how on earth could it be a misunderstanding  derby was out here says daniel
he frightened a maid things got heated and your sister took a shot at him
bell mistook it for a murder  blast derby michael turns abruptly for the house
ill not have it
he can go to the devil under somebody elses roof  it wasnt his fault interrupts daniel
not this time at least
hard as it is to believe derby was trying to help
he simply got the wrong end of the stick  michael stops eyeing daniel suspiciously
are you certain he asks
i am says daniel putting an arm around his friends tense shoulders
it was a dreadful misunderstanding
nobodys fault  thats a first for derby  michael lets out a rueful sigh the fury evaporating from his face
hes a man of fleeting emotions this one quick to anger easily amused and just as easily bored i shouldnt wonder
i briefly imagine what it would be like to inhabit that mind
dances coldness has its drawbacks but its undoubtedly preferable to michaels mood hopscotch
all morning ive been telling the chaps theres a dead body out here and they should be ashamed of being so jolly says michael abashed
as if this weekend wasnt already miserable enough for them  you were helping a friend daniel offers him a fatherly smile
you have nothing to be ashamed of  im taken aback by daniels kindness and more than a little pleased
while i admire his commitment to escaping blackheath im alarmed by his ruthless pursuit of it
suspicion is already my first emotion and fear binds me tighter every minute
it would be easy to mistake everybody for enemies and treat them accordingly and im heartened to see daniel is still capable of rising above such thoughts
as daniel and michael walk close together i take my opportunity to question the young man
i couldnt help but notice your revolver i say pointing to his holster
its your mothers isnt it  is it he seems genuinely surprised
i didnt even know mother kept a gun
evelyn gave it to me this morning  why would she give you a revolver i ask
michael flushes with embarrassment
because i dont like hunting very much he says kicking at some leaves in his path
all that blood and thrashing it makes me feel damn queer
i wasnt even supposed to be out here but between the search and fathers absence i didnt have a great deal of choice
i was in a dreadful state about it but evelyns a clever old stick
she gave me this – he taps the gun – said it was impossible to hit anything but id look very dashing trying  daniels trying to suppress laughter drawing a goodnatured smile from michael
where are your parents michael i say ignoring the teasing
i thought this was their party but the burden of it seems to have fallen solely on your shoulders  he scratches the back of his neck looking gloomy
fathers locked himself in the gatehouse uncle edward
hes brooding as usual  uncle
snatches of dances memory surface fleeting glimpses of a lifelong friendship with peter hardcastle that made me an honorary part of the family
whatever we had has long since faded but im surprised by the affection i still feel for this boy
ive known him his entire life
im proud of him
prouder than of my own son
as for mother continues michael oblivious to my momentary confusion
to tell you the truth shes been acting strangely since we got here
actually i was hoping youd speak with her privately
i think shes avoiding me  and me i counter
i havent managed to catch hold of her all day  he pauses making his mind up on something
lowering his voice he continues confidentially im worried shes gone off the deep end  deep end  its like shes somebody else entirely he says worried
happy one minute angry the next
its impossible to keep track and the way she looks at us now its as if she doesnt recognise us  another rival
the plague doctor said there were three of us the footman anna and myself
i cant see what purpose would be served by lying
i steal a glance at daniel trying to gauge whether he knows anything more about this but his attention is riveted on michael
when did this behaviour start i ask casually
i couldnt tell you feels like forever  but when was the first time you noticed it  he chews his lip cycling back in his memories
the clothes he says suddenly
that would be it
did i tell you about the clothes hes looking at daniel who shakes his head blankly
come now i must have
happened about a year ago  daniel shakes his head again
mother had come up to blackheath for her annual morbid pilgrimage but when she got back to london she burst into my place in mayfair and started ranting about finding the clothes says michael telling the story as though expecting daniel to leap in at any moment
thats all shed say that shed found the clothes and did i know anything about them  whose clothes were they i say humouring him
id been excited to hear about helenas altered personality but if she changed a year ago its unlikely shes another rival
and while theres certainly something strange about her i dont see how laundry can help me decipher what it is
damned if i know he says throwing his hands up
i couldnt get a sensible thing out of her
in the end i managed to calm her down but she wouldnt keep quiet about the clothes
kept saying everybody would know  know what i say
she never did say and she left shortly after but she was adamant  our group is thinning out as the dogs draw the hunters in a different direction herrington sutcliffe and pettigrew waiting for us a little further ahead
theyre obviously hanging back for further directions and after saying his goodbyes michael jogs ahead to point the way
what did you make of that i ask daniel
i havent yet he says vaguely
hes preoccupied his gaze dragging behind michael
we continue in silence until we reach an abandoned village at the bottom of a cliff
eight stone cottages are arranged around a dirt junction the thatched roofs rotted away the logs that once supported them collapsed
echoes of old lives linger still a bucket among the rubble an anvil tipped over by the side of the road
some might find them charming but i see only relics of former hardships happily deserted
nearly time daniel mutters staring at the village
theres a look on his face i cant quite place married to a tone thats impatient excited and a little afraid
it makes my skin prickle
something of note is about to happen here but for the life of me i cant see what it could be
michaels showing sutcliffe and pettigrew one of the old stone houses while stanwin leans against a tree his thoughts far afield
be ready daniel says enigmatically disappearing into the trees before i have the chance to question him further
any other host would follow him but im exhausted
i need to sit down somewhere
settling myself on a crumbling wall i rest while the others talk my eyelids drooping
age is coiling around me its fangs in my neck drawing my strength when i need it most
its an unpleasant sensation perhaps even worse than the burden of ravencourts bulk
at least the initial shock of being ravencourt waned allowing me to become accustomed to his physical limitations
not so with dance who still thinks of himself as a vigorous young man waking up to his age only when he catches sight of his wrinkled hands
even now i can feel him frowning at my decision to sit down to give in to my tiredness
i pinch my arm struggling to stay awake irritated at my vanishing energy
it makes me wonder how old i am outside of blackheath
its not something ive allowed myself to dwell on before time being short enough without indulging in pointless musing but here and now i pray for youth for strength good health and a sound mind
to escape all this only to find myself permanently trapped in      39   day two continued  i wake abruptly stirring the plague doctor whos staring at a gold pocket watch his mask painted a sickly yellow colour by the candle in his hand
im back in the butler swaddled in cotton sheets
right on time says the plague doctor snapping the watch shut
it looks to be dusk the room mired in a gloom only partially beaten back by our small flame
annas shotgun is lying on the bed beside me
what happened i say my voice hoarse
dance is dozing on his wall the plague doctor chuckles placing his candle on the floor and dropping into the small chair by the bed
its far too small for him his greatcoat swallowing the wood completely
no i meant the shotgun
why do i have it  one of your hosts left it for you
dont bother calling for anna he says noticing that im eyeing the door
shes not in the gatehouse
i came to warn you that your rival has almost solved the murder
im expecting him to find me at the lake tonight
you must work quickly from this point onwards  i try to straighten out but the pain in my ribs immediately puts an end to my efforts
why are you so interested in me i ask letting the agony settle into its familiar spots
im sorry  why do you keep coming here for these talks
i know you dont bother with anna and id wager you dont see much of the footman either  whats your name  why does  answer the question he says rapping the floor with his cane
edward da no derby
i i flounder for a moment
aiden something  youre losing yourself to them mr bishop he says crossing his arms and leaning back in his chair
its been happening for a while now
thats why we only allow you eight hosts
any more than that and your personality wouldnt be able to rise above theirs  hes right
my hosts are getting stronger and im getting weaker
its been happening incrementally insidiously
its as though i fell asleep on a beach and now find myself cast out to sea
what do i do i say feeling a surge of panic
hold on he says with a shrug
its all you can do
theres a voice in your mind you must have heard it by now
dry slightly distant
its calm when youre panicked fearless when youre afraid  ive heard it  thats whats left of the original aiden bishop the man who first entered blackheath
its not much more than a fragment any more a little piece of his personality clinging on between loops but if you begin to lose yourself heed that voice
its your lighthouse
everything that remains of the man you once were  with a great rustling of clothing he gets to his feet the candle flame snapping in the breeze
stooping down he lifts the candle from the floor and heads to the door
wait i say
he pauses his back to me
the candlelight forms a warm halo around his body
how many times have we done all of this i ask
thousands i suspect
more than i could possibly count  so why do i keep failing  he sighs looking over his shoulder at me
theres a sense of weariness in his bearing as though every loop is sediment pressing down on him
its a question ive pondered myself from time to time he says melting wax running down the side to stain his glove
chance has played its part stumbling when being sure footed would have saved you
mostly though i think its your nature  my nature i ask
you think im destined to fail  destined
no
that would be an excuse and blackheath is intolerant of excuses he says
nothing thats happening here is inevitable much as it may appear otherwise
events keep happening the same way day after day because your fellow guests keep making the same decisions day after day
they decide to go hunting they decide to betray each other one of them drinks too much and skips breakfast missing a meeting that would change his life forever
they cannot see another way so they never change
you are different mr bishop
loop after loop ive watched you react to moments of kindness and cruelty random acts of chance
you make different decisions and yet repeat the same mistakes at crucial junctures
its as though some part of you is perpetually pulled towards the pit  are you saying i have to become somebody else to escape  im saying every man is in a cage of his own making he says
the aiden bishop who first entered blackheath – he sighs as if the memory troubles him – the things he wanted and his way of getting them were unyielding
that man could never have escaped blackheath
this aiden bishop before me is different
i think youre closer than youve ever been but ive thought that before and been fooled
the truth is youve yet to be tested but thats coming and if youve changed truly changed then who knows there may be hope for you  ducking under the doorframe he moves into the corridor with the candle
you have four hosts after edward dance including whats left of the days of the butler and donald davies
be cautious mr bishop the footman isnt going to rest until theyre all dead and im not sure you can afford to lose a single one of them  with that he closes the door
40   day six continued  dances years fall on me like a thousand small weights
michael and stanwin are speaking behind me sutcliffe and pettigrew laughing uproariously with drinks in their hands
rebecca hovers over me with a silver tray one last glass of brandy for the taking
rebecca i say fondly almost reaching out a hand to touch my wifes cheek
no sir its lucy sir lucy harper says the maid concerned
sorry to wake you i was worried you were going to fall off the wall  i blink away the memory of dances dead wife cursing myself for a fool
what a ridiculous mistake to make
thankfully the remembrance of lucys kindness towards the butler tempers my irritation at being caught in a moment of such sentiment
would you like a drink sir she asks
something to warm you up  i look past her to see evelyns ladys maid madeline aubert packing dirty glasses and halfempty brandy bottles into a hamper
the two of them must have carried it over from blackheath arriving while i slept
i seem to have dozed for longer than i suspected as theyre already readying themselves to leave
i think im unsteady enough i say
her gaze flickers over my shoulder towards ted stanwin whose hand is gripping michael hardcastles shoulder
uncertainty writes itself in large letters across her face which is little wonder considering his treatment of her at lunchtime
dont worry lucy ill take it over to him i say rising and removing the glass of brandy from the tray
i need to speak with him anyway  thank you sir she says with a wide smile departing before i can change my mind
stanwin and michael are quiet when i come upon them but i can hear the things not being said and the unease that stands in its place
michael may i have a private word with mr stanwin i ask
of course says michael inclining his head and withdrawing
i hand stanwin the drink ignoring the suspicion with which he glances at the glass
rare that youd lower yourself to come and talk with me dance says stanwin sizing me up the way a boxer might an opponent in the ring
i thought we could help each other i say
im always interested in making new friends  i need to know what you saw on the morning of thomas hardcastles murder  its an old story he says tracing the edge of his glass with a fingertip
but worth hearing from the horses mouth surely i say
hes looking over my shoulder watching madeline and lucy depart with their hamper
i have the sense hes searching for a distraction
something about dance puts him on edge
no harm in it i suppose he says with a grunt returning his attention to me
i was blackheaths gamekeeper back then
i was on my rounds around the lake same as every morning when i saw carver and another devil with his back to me stabbing the little boy
i took a shot at him but he escaped into the woods while i was wrestling with carver  and for that lord and lady hardcastle gave you a plantation i say
they did not that i asked he sniffs
alf miller the stablemaster says helena hardcastle was with carver that morning a few minutes before the attack
what do you say to that  that hes a drunk and a damned liar says stanwin smoothly
i search for some tremor some hint of unease but hes an accomplished deceiver this one his fidgeting put away now he knows what i want
i can feel the scales tipping in his direction his confidence growing
ive misjudged this
i believed i could bully him as i did the stablemaster and dickie but stanwins nervousness wasnt a symptom of fear it was the unease of a man finding a lone question in his pile of answers
tell me mr dance he says leaning close enough to whisper into my ear
whos the mother of your son
i know it wasnt your dearly departed rebecca
dont get me wrong ive got a few ideas but it would save me the cost of confirming them if youd tell me up front
i might even discount your monthly payment afterwards for services rendered  my blood freezes
this secret sits at the core of dances being
its his greatest shame his only weakness and stanwins just closed his fist around it
i couldnt respond even if i wanted to
stepping away from me stanwin tosses the untouched brandy into the bushes with a flick of his wrist
next time you come to trade make sure you have something  a shotgun explodes behind me
something splashes my face stanwins body jolting backwards before hitting the ground in a mangled heap
my ears are ringing and touching my cheek i find blood on my fingertips
stanwins blood
someone shrieks others gasp and cry out
nobody moves then everybody does
michael and clifford herrington race towards the body hollering for somebody to fetch doctor dickie but its obvious the blackmailers dead
his chest is broken open the malice that drove him flown the coop
one good eye is pointed in my direction an accusation held within
i want to tell him this wasnt my fault that i didnt do this
suddenly that seems like the most important thing in the world
its shock
bushes rustle daniel stepping out smoke rising from the barrel of his shotgun
hes looking down at the body with so little emotion i could almost believe him innocent of the crime
what did you do coleridge cries michael checking stanwin for a pulse
exactly what i promised your father i would do he says flatly
ive made sure ted stanwin will never blackmail any of you again  you murdered him  yes says daniel meeting his shocked gaze
i did  reaching into his pocket daniel hands me a silk handkerchief
clean yourself up old man he says
i take it unthinkingly even thanking him
im dazed bewildered
nothing about this feels real
wiping stanwins blood off my face i stare at the crimson smear on the handkerchief as if it can somehow explain whats happening
i was speaking with stanwin and then he was dead and i dont understand how that could be
surely there should be more
a chase fear a warning of some sort
we shouldnt simply die
it feels like a swindle
so much paid too much asked
were ruined wails sutcliffe slumping against a tree
stanwin always said that if anything happened to him our secrets would be made common knowledge  thats your concern yells herrington wheeling on him
coleridge murdered a man in front of us  a man we all hated sutcliffe shoots back
dont pretend you werent thinking the same thing
dont any of you pretend
stanwin bled us dry in life and hes going to destroy us in death  no he wont says daniel resting the shotgun across his shoulder
hes the only one whos calm the only one who isnt acting like an entirely different person
none of this means anything to him
everything he has on us says pettigrew
is written in a book that i now own interrupts daniel retrieving a cigarette from his silver case
his hands not even shaking
my hand
what the hell does blackheath make me
i commissioned somebody to steal it for me he continues casually lighting his cigarette
your secrets are my secrets and theyll never see the light of day
now i believe each of you owes me a promise
its this you wont mention this to anybody for the rest of the day
is that understood
if anybody asks stanwin stayed behind when we left
he didnt say why and that was the last you saw of him  blank faces find each other everybody too stunned to speak
i cant tell whether theyre aghast at what theyve witnessed or simply overcome by their good fortune
for my part the shock is fading the horror of daniels actions finally sinking in
half an hour ago i was praising him for showing a modicum of kindness to michael
now im covered in another mans blood realising how deeply ive underestimated his desperation
my desperation
this is my future im seeing and it makes me feel sick
i need to hear the words gentleman says daniel blowing smoke from the corner of his mouth
tell me you understand what happened here  assurances arrive in a jumble muted but sincere
only michael seems upset
meeting his gaze daniel speaks coldly
and dont forget i have all of your secrets in my hands he lets that settle
now i think you should head back before anybody comes looking for us  the suggestion is met with a murmur of agreement everybody disappearing back into the forest
signalling for me to remain behind daniel waits until theyre out of earshot before speaking
help me go through his pockets he says rolling up his sleeves
the other hunters will be coming back this way soon and i dont want them to see us with the body  what have you done daniel i hiss
hell be alive tomorrow he says waving his hand dismissively
ive knocked over a scarecrow  were supposed to be solving a murder not committing one  give a little boy an electric train set and hell immediately try to derail it he says
the act does not speak to his character nor do we judge him for it  you think this is a game i snap pointing at stanwins body
a puzzle with disposable pieces
solve it and we get to go home he frowns at me as if im a stranger whos asked directions to a place that doesnt exist
i dont understand your concern  if we solve evelyns murder in the manner youre suggesting we dont deserve to go home
cant you see these masks we wear betray us
they reveal us  youre babbling he says searching stanwins pockets
we are never more ourselves than when we think people arent watching dont you realise that
it doesnt matter if stanwins alive tomorrow you murdered him today
you murdered a man in cold blood and that will blot your soul for the rest of your life
i dont know why were here daniel or why this is happening to us but we should be proving that its an injustice not making ourselves worthy of it  youre misguided he says contempt creeping into his voice
we can no more mistreat these people than we could their shadow cast upon the wall
i dont understand what youre asking of me  that we hold ourselves to a higher standard i say my voice rising
that we be better men than our hosts
murdering stanwin was daniel coleridges solution but it shouldnt be yours
youre a good man you cant lose sight of that  a good man he scoffs
avoiding unpleasant acts doesnt make a man good
look at where we are whats been done to us
escaping this place requires that we do what is necessary even if our nature compels us otherwise
i know this makes you squeamish that you dont have the stomach for it
i was the same but i no longer have the time to tiptoe around my ethics
i can end this tonight and i mean to so dont measure me by how tightly i cling to my goodness measure me by what im willing to sacrifice that you might cling to yours
if i fail you can always try another way  and how will you live with yourself when youre done i demand
ill look at the faces of my family and know that what i lost in this place was not nearly as important as my reward for leaving it  you cant believe that i say
i do and so will you after a few more days in this place he says
now please help me search him before the hunters find us here
i have no intention of wasting my evening answering a policemans questions  its no use arguing with him shutters have come down behind his eyes
i sigh taking myself over to the body
what am i looking for i ask
answers same as always he says unbuttoning the blackmailers bloody jacket
stanwin collected every lie in blackheath including the last piece of our puzzle the reason for evelyns murder
every scrap of knowledge he holds is contained in a book written in code with a separate book of ciphers required to read it
i have the first stanwin keeps the latter on him at all times  that was the book derby stole from stanwins bedroom
did you take it from derby i ask
i was coshed on the head almost as soon as i got my hands on it  of course not he says
coleridge had already commissioned somebody to retrieve the book before i took control of him
i didnt even know he was interested in stanwins blackmail business until the book was delivered to me
if its any consolation i did consider warning you  so why didnt you  he shrugs
derbys a rabid dog it seemed better for everybody to let him sleep for a few hours
now come along were short of time  shuddering i kneel beside the body
this is no way for a man to die even one such as stanwin
his chest is mincemeat and blood has soaked through his clothing
it oozes around my fingers when i delve inside his trouser pockets
i work slowly barely able to look
daniel has no such qualms patting down stanwins shirt and jacket seemingly impervious to the tattered flesh showing through
by the time were finished weve uncovered a cigarette case pocket knife and lighter but no codebook
we glance at each other
we have to roll him over says daniel voicing my thoughts
stanwin was a large man and it takes a great deal of effort to push him onto his front
its worth it
im much more comfortable searching a body that isnt looking up at me
as daniel runs his hands along stanwins trouser legs i lift his jacket spotting a bulge in the lining surrounded by haphazard stitching
a ripple of excitement shames me
the last thing i want is to justify daniels methods but now were on the verge of a discovery im growing more elated
using the dead mans pocket knife i slice the stitches letting the codebook slide into my palm
no sooner has it come free than i notice theres something else in there
reaching inside i pull out a small silver locket its chain removed
theres a painting inside and though its old and cracked its obviously of a little girl around seven or eight with red hair
i hold it out to daniel buts he too busy flipping through the codebook to pay attention
this is it he says excitedly
this is our way out  i certainly hope so i say
we paid a high price for it  he looks up from the book a different man to the one who started reading it
this is neither bells daniel nor ravencourts
its not even the man of a few minutes ago arguing the necessity of his actions
this is a man victorious one foot already out of the door
im not proud of what i did he says
but we couldnt have done this any other way you must believe that  he may not be proud but hes not ashamed either
that much is evident and im reminded of the plague doctors warning
the aiden bishop who first entered blackheath the things he wanted and his way of getting them were unyielding
that man could never have escaped blackheath
in his desperation daniels making the same mistakes i always have exactly as the plague doctor warned me i would
whatever happens i cant let myself become this
are you ready to go says daniel
do you know the way home i say searching the forest and realising i have no idea how we arrived here
its east he says
and which way is that  thrusting a hand into his pocket he brings out bells compass
i borrowed it from him this morning he says laying it flat in his palm
funny how things repeat isnt it      41   we come upon the house rather unexpectedly the trees giving way to the muddy lawn its windows burning bright with candlelight
i must admit im glad to see it
despite the shotgun ive spent the entire journey glancing over my shoulder for the footman
if the codebook is as valuable as daniel believes i must assume our enemy is also in pursuit of it
hell be coming for us soon
silhouettes are passing back and forth in the upper windows hunters trudging up the steps into the golden glow of the entrance hall where caps and jackets are wrenched loose and discarded filthy water pooling on the marble
a maid moves among us with a tray of sherry from which daniel plucks two glasses handing me one
clinking my glass he throws his drink down his throat as michael arrives at our side
as with the rest of us he looks to have crawled off the ark his dark hair plastered to his pale face by the rain
glancing at his watch i discover its 607 pm  ive sent a couple of trustworthy servants to collect stanwin he whispers taking a sherry from the tray
i told them i stumbled on his body coming back from the hunt and instructed them to inter him in one of the old potting sheds
nobody will find him and i wont summon the police until early tomorrow morning
im sorry but i wont leave him to rot in the forest any longer than i have to  he clutches a halfempty glass of sherry and though the drink has put a little colour in his cheeks its not nearly enough
the crowd in the hall is thinning out now
a couple of maids have already appeared with buckets of sudsy water and are waiting in the wings with their mops and their frowns trying to shame us into leaving so they can get to work
rubbing his eyes michael looks at us directly for the first time
im going to honour my fathers promise he says
but i dont like it  michael says daniel reaching out a hand but michael steps away
no please he says his sense of betrayal palpable
well speak another day but not now not tonight  he turns his back on us heading up the stairs towards his bedroom
never mind him says daniel
he thinks i acted from greed
he doesnt understand how important this is
the answers are in the ledger i know it  hes excited like a boy with a new catapult
were almost there dance he says
were almost free  and then what happens i say
do you walk out of here
do i
we cant both escape were the same man  i dont know he says
presumably aiden bishop wakes up again his memories intact
hopefully he wont remember either of us
were bad dreams best forgotten he checks his watch
lets not think about that now
anna has arranged to meet bell in the graveyard this evening
if shes right the footmans heard about it and is sure to show
shell need us to help capture him
that gives us about four hours to dig what we need out of this book
why dont you get changed and come up to my room
well do it together  ill be right along i say
his giddiness is a rare fillip
tonight well deal with the footman and deliver the plague doctors answer
somewhere in the house my other hosts are surely refining their plans to save evelyns life which means i simply need to work out how to save anna as well
i cannot believe shes been lying to me this whole time and i cannot imagine leaving this place without her by my side not after everything shes done to help me
floorboards echo as i return to my room the house grumbling under the weight of the returned
everybody will be getting ready for dinner
i envy them their evening for a darker purpose lies ahead of me
much darker the footman will not go quietly
there you are i say glancing around to make sure nobodys listening
is it true youre whats left of the original aiden bishop  silence greets my question and somewhere within i can feel dance sneering at me
i can only imagine what the stiff old solicitor would say about a man talking to himself in this fashion
aside from the dim light of the fire my bedroom is shrouded the servants having forgotten to light the candles ahead of my arrival
suspicion pricks me
i raise the shotgun to my shoulder
a gamekeeper tried to collect it when we came inside but i brushed him off insisting it was part of my personal collection
sparking the lantern beside the door i see anna standing in the corner of the room arms by her sides expression blank
anna i say surprised lowering the shotgun
whats the  wood creaks behind me pain flares in my side
a rough hand yanks me backwards covering my mouth
im spun around bringing me face to face with the footman
theres a smirk on his lips his eyes scratching at my face as though digging for something buried beneath
those eyes
i try to scream but he clamps my jaw shut
he holds his knife up
very slowly he runs the point down my chest before ramming it into my stomach the pain of each blow eclipsing the one before until pain is all there is
ive never been so cold never felt so quiet
my legs buckle his arms taking my weight lowering me carefully to the floor
he keeps his eyes on mine soaking up the life slipping out of them
i open my mouth to scream but no sound comes out
run rabbit he says his face close to mine
run      42   day two continued  i scream lurching up from the butlers bed only to be pressed back down by the footman
this him he says looking over his shoulder at anna whos standing by the window
yes she says a tremor in her voice
the footman leans close his voice hoarse alethick breath warm on my cheek
didnt leap far enough rabbit he says
the blade slips into my side my blood spilling onto the sheets taking my life with it
43   day seven  i scream into suffocating darkness my back against a wall my knees tucked under my chin
instinctively i grab the spot where the butler was stabbed cursing my stupidity
the plague doctor was telling the truth
anna betrayed me
i feel sick my mind scrambling for a reasonable explanation but i saw her myself
shes been lying to me this whole time
she isnt the only one guilty of that
shut up i say angrily
my heart is racing my breathing shallow
i need to calm down or ill be no use to anybody
taking a minute i try to think of anything but anna but its surprisingly difficult
i hadnt realised how often my mind has reached for her in the quiet
she was safety and comfort
she was my friend
shifting position i try to work out where ive woken up and whether im in any immediate danger
at first blush it doesnt appear so
my shoulders are touching the walls either side of me a sliver of light piercing a crack near my right ear dusting cardboard boxes on my left and bottles down by my feet
i move my wristwatch to the light discovering that its 1013 am bell hasnt even reached the house yet
its still morning i say to myself relieved
i still have time  my lips are dry my tongue cracked the air so thick with mildew it feels like a dirty rags been stuffed down my throat
a drink would be nice something cold anything with ice
it seems a long time since ive woken up beneath cotton sheets the days torments queuing patiently on the other side of a warm bath
i didnt know when i was well off
my host must have slept in this position all night because its agony to move
thankfully the panel to the right of me is loose and pushes open without too much effort my eyes watering as theyre exposed to the harsh brightness of the room beyond
im in a long gallery stretching the length of the house cobwebs dangling from the ceiling
the walls are dark wood the floor littered with dozens of pieces of old furniture that are thick with dust and almost hollowed out by woodworm
brushing myself off i get to my feet shaking some life into my iron limbs
turns out my host spent the night in a storage cupboard beneath a small flight of stairs leading up to a stage
yellowed sheet music sits open in front of a dusty cello and looking at it i feel like ive slept through some great calamity judgement having come and gone while i was stuffed in that cupboard
what the hell was i doing under there
aching i stagger over to one of the windows lining the gallery
its shrouded with grime but wiping a spot clear with my sleeve reveals blackheaths gardens below
im on the top floor of the house
out of habit i begin searching my pockets for some clue as to my identity but realise i dont need it
im jim rashton
im twentyseven a constable in the police force and my parents margaret and henry beam with pride whenever they tell anybody
i have a sister i have a dog and im in love with a woman called grace davies whos the reason im at this party
whatever barrier used to exist between myself and my hosts is almost completely knocked through
i can barely tell rashtons life from my own
unfortunately my recollection of how i came to end up in the cupboard is clouded by the bottle of scotch that rashton was drinking last night
i remember telling old stories laughing and dancing barrelling recklessly through an evening that had no other purpose than pleasure
was the footman there
did he do this
i strain for the memory but last nights a drunken smear
agitation instinctively sends my hand to the leather cigarette case rashton keeps in his pocket but theres only one cigarette left inside
im tempted to light it to calm my nerves but given the circumstances a frayed temper might serve me better especially if i have to fight my way out of here
the footman tracked me from dance into the butler so its doubtful ill find safe harbour in rashton
caution will be my truest friend now
casting around for a weapon i find a bronze statue of atlas
i creep forwards with it held above my head picking my way through walls of armoires and giant webs of interlocking chairs until i arrive at a faded black curtain stretching the length of the room
cardboard trees are propped against the walls near clothes racks stuffed with costumes
among them are six or seven plague doctor outfits the hats and masks piled in a box on the floor
it appears the family used to put on plays up here
a floorboard creaks the curtain twitching
somebodys shuffling around back there
i tense
raising atlas above my head i  anna bursts through her cheeks red
oh thank god she says catching sight of me
shes out of breath dark circles surrounding bloodshot brown eyes
her blonde hair is loose and tangled her cap scrunched up in her hand
the artists sketchbook chronicling each of my hosts bulges in her apron
youre rashton right
come on we only have half an hour to save the others she says lunging forward to take hold of my hand
i step back the statue still raised but the breathlessness of the introduction has knocked me off balance as has the lack of guilt in her voice
im not going anywhere with you i say gripping atlas a little tighter
confusion paints her face followed by a dawning realisation
is this because of what happened to dance and the butler she asks
i dont know anything about that about anything really
ive havent been up long
i just know youre in eight different people and a footmans killing them and we need to go and save the ones that are left  you expect me to trust you i say stunned
you distracted dance while the footman murdered him
you were standing in the room when he killed the butler
youve been helping him ive seen you  she shakes her head
dont be an idiot she cries
i havent done any of that yet and even when i do it wont be because im betraying you
if i wanted you dead id pick off your hosts before they ever woke up
you wouldnt see me and i certainly wouldnt work with a man guaranteed to turn on me once wed finished  then what were you doing there i demand
i dont know i havent lived that part yet she snaps back
you – another you i mean – were waiting for me when i woke up
he gave me a book that told me to find derby in the forest then come here and save you
thats my day
thats everything i know  its not enough i say bluntly
i havent done any of that so i dont know if youre telling the truth  putting the statue down i walk past her heading for the black curtain she emerged through
i cant trust you anna i say
why not she says catching my trailing hand
im trusting you  thats not  do you remember anything from our previous loops  only your name i say looking down at her fingers intertwined with mine my resistance already crumbling
i want to believe her so badly
but you dont remember how any of them ended  no i say impatiently
why are you asking me this  because i do she says
the reason i know your name is because i remember calling for you in the gatehouse
wed arranged to meet there
you were late and i was worried
i was so happy to see you and then i saw the look on your face  her eyes find mine the pupils wide and dark and daring
theyre guileless
surely she couldnt have  everybody in this house is wearing a mask
you murdered me right where i stood she says touching my cheek studying the face i still havent seen
when you found me this morning i was so scared i almost ran away but you were so broken so scared
all your lives had crashed down on top of you
you couldnt tell one from another you didnt even know who you were
you pushed this book into my hands and said you were sorry
you kept repeating it
you told me you werent that man any more and that we couldnt get out of this by making the same mistakes all over again
it was the last thing you said  memories are stirring slowly and so far away that i feel like a man reaching across a river to trap a butterfly between his fingers
she presses the chess piece into my palm curling my fingers around it
this might help she says
we used these pieces in the last loop to identify ourselves
a bishop for you aiden bishop and a knight for me
the protector like now  i remember the guilt the sorrow
i remember the regret
there arent images there isnt even a memory
it doesnt matter
i can feel the truth of what shes saying as i felt the strength of our friendship the first time we met and the agony of the grief that brought me to blackheath
shes right i murdered her
do you remember now she says
i nod ashamed and sick to my stomach
i didnt want to hurt her i know that
wed been working together like today but something changed
i became desperate
i saw my escape slipping away and i panicked
i promised myself id find a way to get her out after id left
i couched my betrayal in noble intentions and i did something awful
i shudder waves of revulsion washing over me
i dont know which loop the memory is from says anna
but i think i held on to it as a warning to myself
a warning not to trust you again  im sorry anna i say
i
i let myself forget what i did
i held on to your name instead
it was a promise to myself and to you that id do better next time  and youre keeping that promise she says soothingly
i wish that were true but i know its not
ive seen my future
ive spoken with him helped him in his schemes
daniel is making the same mistakes i made in my last loop
desperation has made him ruthless and unless i stop him hes going to sacrifice anna again
why didnt you tell me the truth when we first met i say still ashamed
because you already knew she says wrinkling her forehead
from my perspective we met two hours ago and you knew everything about me  the first time i met you i was cecil ravencourt i respond
then were meeting in the middle because i dont know who that is yet she says
it doesnt matter though
i wont tell him or any of the others because it doesnt matter
it wasnt us in those loops
whoever they were they made different choices different mistakes
im choosing to trust you aiden and i need you to trust me because this place is you know how it works
whatever you think i was doing when the footman killed you it wasnt everything
it wasnt the truth  shed seem confident if it werent for the nervous throb in her throat the way her foot worries at the floor
i can feel her hand trembling against my cheek the strain in her voice
beneath all the bravado shes still afraid of me of the man i was of the man who may still be lurking within
i cant imagine the courage it took to bring her here
i dont know how to get us both out of here anna  i know  but i will i wont leave without you i promise  i know that too  and thats when she slaps me
thats for murdering me she says standing on her tiptoes to plant a kiss on the sting
now lets go and make sure the footman doesnt murder any more of you      44   wood creaks the narrow twisting staircase darkening the further down we get until finally we sink beneath the gloom
do you know why i was in that cupboard i ask anna whos ahead of me and moving fast enough to outrun a falling sky
no idea but it saved your life she says glancing back at me over her shoulder
the book said the footman would be coming for rashton around this time
if hed slept in his bedroom last night the footman would have found him  maybe we should let him find me i say feeling a rush of excitement
come on ive got an idea  i push past anna and begin leaping down the steps two at a time
if the footmans coming for rashton this morning theres every chance hell still be lurking around the corridors
hell be expecting a man asleep in his bed which means ive got the upper hand for once
with a little luck i can put an end to this here and now
the steps end abruptly at a whitewashed wall anna still halfway up and calling for me to slow down
a police officer of considerable skill – as hed freely admit himself – rashtons no stranger to hidden things
my fingers expertly locate a disguised catch allowing me to tumble into the dark hallway outside
candles flicker behind sconces the sun room standing empty on my left
ive emerged on the ground floor the door i came through already blending into the wall
the footman is less than twenty yards away
hes on his knees jimmying the lock to what i instinctively know is my bedroom
looking for me you bastard i spit hurling myself at him before he has a chance to grab his knife
hes on his feet quicker than i could have imagined leaping backwards and kicking out to catch me in the chest knocking the wind from me
i land awkwardly clutching my ribs but he doesnt move
hes standing there waiting wiping saliva from the corner of his mouth with the back of his hand
brave rabbit he says grinning
im going to gut you slow  rising and dusting myself off i raise my fists in a boxers stance suddenly aware of how heavy my arms feel
that night in the cupboards done me no favours and my confidence is ebbing away by the second
this time i approach him slowly feinting left and right working an opening that never comes
a jab catches my chin rocking my head back
i dont even see the second punch that smashes into my stomach or the third that puts me on the floor
im disorientated dizzy struggling for breath as the footman looms over me dragging me up by my hair and stretching for his knife
hey shouts anna
its the slightest of distractions but its enough
slipping free of the footmans hold i kick his knee then launch my shoulder up into his face breaking his nose blood splattering my shirt
reeling backwards down the corridor he grabs hold of a bust and hurls it at me onehanded forcing me to leap aside as he flees around the corner
i want to go after him but i dont have the strength
i slide down the wall until im sitting on the floor clutching my aching ribs
im shaken and unnerved
he was too fast too strong
if that fight had gone on any longer id be dead im certain of it
you bloody idiot yells anna glowering at me
you almost got yourself killed  did he catch sight of you i say spitting out the blood in my mouth
i dont think so she says reaching out a hand to help me up
i kept to the shadows and i doubt he was seeing much after you broke his nose  im sorry anna i say
i honestly thought we could catch hold of him  you damn well should be she says surprising me with a fierce hug her body trembling
you have to be careful aiden
thanks to that bastard youve only got a few hosts left
if you make a mistake were going to be stuck here  realisation hits me like a rock
i only have three hosts left i repeat stunned
sebastian bell fainted after seeing the dead rabbit in the box
the butler dance and derby were slain and ravencourt fell asleep in the ballroom after watching evelyn commit suicide
that leaves rashton davies and gregory gold
between the split days and leaping back and forth i lost count
i should have seen it immediately
daniel claimed he was the last of my hosts but that cant be true
a warm blanket of shame pulls itself over my body
i cant believe i was so easily deceived
so willingly deceived
it wasnt entirely your fault
the plague doctor warned me anna would betray me
why would he do that when it was daniel who was lying to me
and why would he tell me there were only three people trying to escape this house when there are four
hes gone out of his way to conceal daniels duplicity
ive been so blind i say hollowly
whats wrong says anna pulling away and looking at me with concern
i falter my mind clicking into gear as embarrassment gives way to cold calculation
daniels lies were elaborate but their purpose remains obscure
i could understand him trying to earn my trust if he wanted to profit from my investigation but thats not the case
hes barely asked about it
quite the contrary he gave me a head start by telling me it was evelyn who would be murdered at the ball and he warned me about the footman
i can no longer call him a friend but i cant be certain hes an enemy either
i need to know where he stands and the best way of doing that is to maintain the illusion of ignorance until he reveals his true intentions
i have to begin with anna
god help us if she let anything slip to derby or dance
their first reaction to a problem is to run at it even if its wrapped in thorns
annas watching me waiting for an answer
i know something i say meeting her eyes
something that matters to both of us but i cant tell you what it is  youre worried about changing the day she says as if its the most obvious thing in the world
dont worry this books full of things im not allowed to tell you she smiles her concern washing away
i trust you aiden
i wouldnt be here if i didnt  holding out a hand she helps me off the floor
we cant stay in this corridor she says
im only alive because he doesnt know who i am
if he sees us together i wont live long enough to help you she smooths her apron and straightens her cap dropping her chin enough to appear diffident
ill go ahead
meet me outside bells bedroom in ten minutes and keep your eyes open
once the footmans healed up hell be looking for you  i agree but i have no intention of waiting in this draughty corridor
everything thats happening today has helena hardcastles fingerprints on it
i need to speak with her and this might be my last chance
still nursing my injured pride and ribs i look for her in the drawing room finding only a few early risers gossiping about how derby was hauled off by stanwins thug
sure enough his plate of eggs and kidneys is sitting on the table where he discarded it
its still warm he cant have long departed
nodding to them i make my way to helenas bedroom but knocking on her door brings only silence
running short of time i kick it open shattering the lock
thats the mystery of who broke in solved
the curtains are drawn the tangled sheets on the fourposter bed trailing off the mattress onto the floor
the room has the soiled atmosphere of a troubled sleep the sweat of nightmares as yet unwashed by fresh air
the wardrobe is open a vanity table covered in spilled powder from a large tin cosmetics torn open and pushed aside suggesting lady hardcastle attended her toilet in something of a hurry
laying my hand on the bed i find it cold
shes already been gone some time
just as when i visited this room with millicent derby the rolldown bureau stands open todays page torn from helenas dayplanner and the lacquered gun case emptied of the two revolvers it should contain
evelyn must have taken them very early this morning probably after receiving the note compelling her to commit suicide
she would have had no trouble slipping through the connecting door from her bedroom after her mother left
but if she intends on shooting herself with the revolver why does she end up using the silver pistol derby stole from doctor dickie instead
and why would she take both revolvers from the case
i know she gives one to michael to use on the hunt but i cant imagine that was foremost in her mind after discovering her own life and that of her friend was being threatened
my eyes drift towards the dayplanner and its tornout page
is this also evelyns work or is somebody else responsible
millicent suspected helena hardcastle
running my fingertip along the torn edge i let myself worry
ive seen helenas appointments in lord hardcastles planner so i know the missing page refers to her meetings with cunningham evelyn millicent derby the stablemaster and ravencourt
the only one of those i can be certain helena hardcastle kept is with cunningham
he admitted it to dance and his inksmudged fingerprints are all over the pages
i slam the book closed in agitation
theres still so much i dont understand and im running short of time
ideas gnaw at me as i head upstairs to anna whos pacing back and forth outside bells bedroom examining the sketchbook in her hands
i can hear muffled voices on the other side of the door
daniel must be talking to bell in there which means the butler is down in the kitchen with mrs drudge
hell be along shortly
have you seen gold
he should already be here says anna staring into the shadows perhaps hoping to carve him out of the gloom with the sharpness of her glare
i havent i say looking around nervously
why are we here  the footman will kill the butler and gold this morning unless we get them somewhere safe where i can protect them she says
like the gatehouse  exactly
only it cant look like thats what were doing
if it does the footman will know who i am and kill me as well
if he thinks im just a nursemaid and theyre too injured to be a threat hell leave us be for a little while and thats what we want
the book reckons theyve still got a role to play in all this assuming we can keep them alive  so what do you need me for  damned if i know
im not exactly sure what im supposed to be doing
the book says to bring you here at this time but – she sighs shaking her head – that was the only clear instruction everything else is gibberish
its like i said you werent exactly lucid when you gave it to me
ive spent most of the last hour trying to decipher the pages knowing if i read them wrong or arrive too late youll die  i shiver unnerved by this brief glimpse at my future
the book must have been given to anna by gregory gold my final host
i can still remember him raving at dances door about the carriage
i remember thinking how pitiable he was how frightening
those dark eyes wild and lost
im not looking forward to tomorrow
folding my arms i lean against the wall next to her our shoulders touching
knowing youve killed somebody in a previous life tends to narrow possible avenues of affection
youve done a better job than i did i say
the first time somebody handed me the future i ended up chasing a maid called madeline aubert halfway across the forest thinking i was saving her life
i nearly frightened the poor girl to death  this day should come with instructions she says glumly
do whatever comes naturally  im not sure running and hiding would help us she says her frustration punctured by the sound of hurried steps on the staircase
without a word we scatter out of sight anna disappearing around the corner while i duck into an open bedroom
curiosity compels me to keep the door open a crack allowing me to see the butler limping down the corridor towards us his burnt body even more wretched in motion
he looks balled up and tossed away a collection of sharp angles under a ratty brown dressing gown and pyjamas
having relived so many of these moments since that first morning i would have thought id become numb but i can feel the butlers frustration and fear as he races to confront bell about this new body hes trapped within
gregory gold is stepping out of a bedroom the butler too preoccupied to notice
at this distance with his back to me the artist seems oddly shapeless less a man more a long shadow thrown up the wall
theres a poker in his hand and without any warning he begins striking the butler with it
i remember this attack this pain
pity takes me a sickening sense of helplessness as blood is sent flying by the poker freckling the walls
im with the butler as he shrivels up on the floor begging for mercy and reaching for help that isnt coming
and thats when reason washes its hands of me
snatching a vase from the sideboard i burst out into the corridor advancing on gold with hells own wrath and smashing it over his head shards of porcelain falling around him as he collapses to the floor
silence congeals in the air as i clutch the broken rim of the vase while staring at the two unconscious men at my feet
anna appears behind me
what happened she says feigning surprise
i  theres a crowd gathering at the end of the corridor halfdressed men and startled women roused from their beds by the commotion
their eyes travel from the blood on the walls to the bodies on the floor latching onto me with an unbecoming curiosity
if the footmans among them hes ducked out of sight
its probably for the best
im angry enough to try something reckless again
doctor dickie is rushing up the stairs and unlike the other guests hes already dressed that huge moustache expertly oiled his balding head gleaming with some lotion
what the devil happened here he exclaims
gold went mad i say bringing a tremor of emotion to my voice
he started attacking the butler with the poker so i  i wave the rim of the vase at him
fetch my medical bag girl says dickie to anna whos positioned herself in his eyeline
its near my bed  doing as shes bid anna begins deftly sliding pieces of the future into place without ever appearing to take control
the doctor requires somewhere warm and quiet to tend the butler so anna recommends the gatehouse while volunteering to administer his medications
by simple expedient of having nowhere else to lock him up its decided gold should be taken over to the gatehouse as well with sedatives to be administered regularly until a servant can bring a policeman back from the village – a servant anna volunteers to find
they descend the staircase with the butler on a makeshift stretcher anna offering me a relieved smile as she goes
i meet it with a perplexed frown
all this effort and im still not certain what weve accomplished
the butler will be consigned to bed making him easy pickings for the footman this evening
gregory gold is going to be sedated and strung up
hell live but his mind is broken
thats hardly a reassuring thought considering its his instructions were following
gold gave anna that book and while hes the last of my hosts i have no idea what hes trying to accomplish
i cant even be certain he knows
not after everything hes suffered
i dig through my memories searching for the pieces of the future ive glimpsed but not yet lived
i still need to know what the all of them message cunningham delivers to derby means and why he tells him hes gathered some people together
i dont know why evelyn takes the silver pistol from derby when she already has the black revolver from her mothers room or why he ends up guarding a rock while she takes her own life
its frustrating
i can see the breadcrumbs laid out ahead of me but for all i know theyre leading me towards a cliff edge
unfortunately theres no other path to follow
45   freed of edward dances advanced years id also hoped to shed his niggling pains but my night in the cupboard has wrapped my bones in brambles
every stretch every bend and twist brings a jolt of pain and a wince piling some new complaint atop the mound
the journey to my bedroom has proven unexpectedly taxing
evidently rashton made quite an impression last night because my passage through the house is punctuated by hearty handshakes and backslaps
greetings lie scattered in my wake like tossed rocks their goodwill bringing me out in bruises
upon reaching my bedroom i throw off my forced smile
theres a white envelope on the floor something bulky sealed inside
somebody must have slipped it under my door
tearing it open i look up and down the corridor for any sign of the person who left it
you left it  begins the note inside which is wrapped around a chess piece thats almost identical to the one anna carries around with her
take amyl nitrite pearls sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate
keep hold of them
gg  gregory gold i sigh reading the initials
he must have left it before attacking the butler
now i know how anna feels
the instructions are barely legible and incomprehensible even once im able to untangle his terrible handwriting
throwing the note and chess piece on the sideboard i lock my door and bar it with a chair
normally id go immediately to rashtons possessions or a mirror to inspect this new face but i already know whats in his drawers and how he looks
i need only stretch my thought towards a question to find its answer which is why i know theres a set of brass knuckles hidden in the sock drawer
he confiscated them from a brawler a few years back and theyve come in handy more than once
i slip them on thinking only of the footman and how he lowered his face to mine breathing in my last breath and sighing with pleasure as he added me to some private tally
my hands are shaking but rashton isnt bell
fear motivates rather than cripples
he wants to seek the footman out and put an end to him to take back whatever dignity was lost in our previous confrontation
looking back at our fight this morning im certain it was rashton who sent me down the stairs and into the corridor
that was his anger his pride
he had control and i didnt even notice
it cant happen again
rashtons recklessness will get us killed and i cant waste the host
if im to get myself and anna out of this mess i need to get ahead of the footman rather than constantly trailing behind him and i think i know somebody who can help though they wont be easy to convince
taking off the brass knuckles i fill the sink and begin washing in front of the mirror
rashtons a young man – though not quite as young as he pictures himself – tall strong and remarkably handsome
freckles are splashed across his nose honeycoloured eyes and short blond hair suggesting a face spun out of sunlight
about the only note of imperfection is an old bullet scar on his shoulder the ragged line long faded
the memory would give itself to me if i asked but ive enough pain without inviting another mans misery into my mind
im wiping my chest when the door handle rattles causing me to snatch up the brass knuckles
jim are you in there
somebodys locked the door  its a womans voice husky and dry
putting on a fresh shirt i pull away the chair and unlock the door to find a confusedlooking young woman on the other side her fist raised for another knock
blue eyes peer at me from beneath long eyelashes a dash of red lipstick the only colour on a glacial face
shes in her early twenties with thick black hair tumbling over a crisp white shirt tucked into jodhpurs her presence immediately setting rashtons blood racing
grace my host shoves the name onto my tongue and plenty more besides
im boiling in a stew of adoration elation arousal and inadequacy
have you heard what that damn fool brother of mine has done she says barging past me
i suspect im about to  he borrowed one of the cars last night she says flinging herself onto the bed
woke the stablemaster at two in the morning dressed like a rainbow and took off for the village  shes got it all wrong but i have no way of salvaging her brothers good name
it was my decision to take the car to flee the house and make for the village
at this moment poor donald davies is asleep on a dirt road where i abandoned him and my host is trying to drag me out of the door after him
his loyalty is almost overpowering and searching for a reason im immediately beset by horrors
rashtons affection for donald davies was moulded amid the mud and blood of the trenches
they went to war as fools and came back brothers each of them broken in places only the other could see
i can feel his anger at my treatment of his friend
or perhaps im just angry at myself
were so jumbled together i can no longer tell
its my fault says grace crestfallen
he was going to buy more of that poison from bell so i threatened to tell daddy
i knew he was angry with me but i didnt think hed run off she sighs helplessly
you dont think hes done something foolish do you  hes fine i say reassuringly sitting down next to her
hes got the wind up thats all  i wish wed never met that damn doctor she says smoothing the creases from my shirt with the flat of her hand
donald hasnt been the same since bell turned up with his trunk of tricks
its that damnable laudanum its got hold of him
i can barely talk to him any more
i wish there was something we could  her words run smack bang into an idea
i can see her standing back from it wideeyed following it from start to finish like a horse shes backed in the derby
i need to go and see charles about something she says abruptly kissing me on the lips before darting into the corridor
shes gone before i can respond the door hanging open in her wake
i stand up to close it hot bothered and not a little confused
on the whole things were simpler when i was in that cupboard
46   step by slow step i proceed down the corridor poking my head into every bedroom before allowing myself to walk past it
im wearing the brass knuckles and jumping at every noise and shadow wary of the assault im certain is coming knowing i cant beat the footman should he catch me unawares
pushing aside the velvet curtain blocking the corridor i pass into blackheaths abandoned east wing a sharp wind stirring drapes that slap the wall like slabs of meat hitting a butchers counter
i dont stop until i reach the nursery
derbys unconscious body isnt immediately obvious as its been dragged into the corner of the room out of sight of the door and behind the rocking horse
his head is a mess of congealed blood and broken pottery but hes alive and well hidden
considering he was attacked coming out of stanwins bedroom whoever was responsible obviously had enough of a conscience to keep the blackmailer from finding and killing him but not enough time to take him anywhere safer
i quickly rifle through his pockets but everything he took from stanwin has been stolen
i didnt expect otherwise but as he is the architect of so many of the houses mysteries it was worth a try
leaving him sleeping i continue on to stanwins rooms at the end of the passage
surely only fear could have pushed him into this misbegotten corner of the house so far from the meagre comforts afforded by the rest of blackheath
by that criterion though hes chosen well
the floorboards are his spies screaming my approach with every step and the long corridor offers only one way in and out
the blackmailer clearly believes himself surrounded by enemies a fact which i may be able to exploit
passing through the reception room i knock on stanwins bedroom door
a strange silence greets me the din of somebody trying to be quiet
its constable jim rashton i call through the wood putting the brass knuckles away
i need to speak with you  the declaration is met with a flurry of sounds
steps go lightly across the room a drawer scrapes something is lifted and moved before finally a voice creeps around the doorframe
come in says ted stanwin
hes sitting on a chair a hand stuck inside his left boot which hes brushing with a soldiers vigour
i shiver a little rocked by a powerful sense of the uncanny
the last time i saw this man he was dead on a forest floor and i was going through his pockets
blackheaths picked him up and dusted him off winding his key so he can do it all again
if this isnt hell the devil is surely taking notes
i look past him
his bodyguard is sleeping deeply on the bed breathing noisily through his bandaged nose
im surprised stanwin hasnt moved him and more surprised to see how the blackmailers angled his chair to face the bed much as anna has done with the butler
clearly stanwin feels some affection for this chap
i wonder how hed react knowing derbys been next door this whole time
ah the man at the centre of it all says stanwin the brush pausing while he regards me
im afraid you have me at a loss i say confused
i wouldnt be a very good blackmailer if i didnt he says gesturing towards a rickety wooden chair by the fire
accepting his invitation i drag the chair closer to the bed making sure to avoid the dirty newspaper and boot polish strewn on the floor
stanwins wearing a rich mans approximation of a stable hands livery which is to say the white cotton shirt is pressed and the black trousers are spotless
looking at him now dressed plainly scrubbing his own boots and squatting in a crumbling corner of a oncegrand house i fail to see what nineteen years of blackmail have bought him
burst blood vessels riddle his cheeks and nose while sunken eyes red raw and hungry for sleep keep watch for the monsters at his door
monsters he invited there
behind all his bluster is a soul turned to ash the fire that once drove him long extinguished
these are the ragged edges of a man defeated his secrets the only warmth left to him
at this point hes as much afraid of his victims as they are of him
pity pricks me
something about stanwins situation feels terribly familiar and deep down beneath my hosts where the real aiden bishop resides i can feel a memory stirring
i came here because of a woman
i wanted to save her and i couldnt
blackheath was my chance to what try again
what did i come here to do
leave it alone
lets state facts plainly says stanwin looking at me steadily
youre in league with cecil ravencourt charles cunningham daniel coleridge and a few others the lot of you fishing around a murder that happened nineteen years ago  my prior thoughts scatter
oh dont look so shocked he says inspecting a dull spot on his boot
cunningham came asking questions early this morning on behalf of that fat master of his and daniel coleridge was sniffing around a few minutes after that
both of them wanted to know about the man i shot when i chased master hardcastles murderer off
now here you are
aint hard to see what youre up to not if youve two eyes and a brain behind them  he glances at me the façade of nonchalance slipping to reveal the calculation at its foundation
aware of his eyes upon me i dig for the right words anything to repudiate his suspicion but the silence stretches growing taut
wondered how youd take it grunts stanwin putting his boot down on the newspaper and wiping his hands clean with a rag
when he speaks again its low and soft the voice of somebody telling stories
seems to me this sudden lust for justice probably has one of two causes he says digging at the dirt beneath his fingernails with a penknife
either ravencourts caught the whiff of scandal and hes paying you to look into it for him or you think theres a big case waiting to be solved that will put you in the papers and make your name  he sneers at my silence
look rashton you dont know me or my business but it knows men like you
youre a workingclass plod walking out with a rich woman you cant afford
nothing wrong with climbing done it myself but youre going to need money to get on the ladder and i can help
information is valuable which means we can help each other  hes holding my gaze but not comfortably
a pulse throbs violently in his neck sweat gathering on his forehead
theres danger in this approach and he knows it
even so i can feel the lure of his offer
rashton would love nothing more than to pay his way with grace
hed like to buy finer clothes and pay for dinner more than once a month
thing is he loves being a copper more
how many people know that lucy harper is your daughter i say blandly
now its my turn to watch his face fall
my suspicions were raised when i watched him bully lucy at the lunch table all because she had the temerity to use his first name when asking him to move out of the way
i didnt think much of it when i saw it through bells eyes
stanwin is a brute and a blackmailer so it seemed only natural
it was only when i witnessed it again as dance that i caught the affection in lucys voice and the fear on his face
a roomful of men whod happily stick a knife in his ribs and there she is all but telling them that she cares about him
she might as well have painted a target on her back
no wonder he lashed out
he needed her out of that room as quickly as possible
lucy who he says the rag twisting tight in his hands
dont insult me by denying it stanwin i interrupt
she has your red hair and you keep a locket with her picture in your jacket along with a codebook detailing your blackmailing business
odd things to keep together except theyre the only things you care about
you should have heard how she defended you to ravencourt  each fact out of my mouth is a hammer blow
it isnt hard to figure out i say
not for a man with two eyes and a brain behind them  what do you want he asks quietly
i need to know what really happened the morning thomas hardcastle was murdered  his tongue roams his lips as his mind gets to work cogs and gears lubricated by lies
charlie carver and another man took thomas out to the lake then stabbed him to death he says picking up the boot once again
i stopped carver but the other one got away
any other old stories you want to hear  if i was interested in lies id have asked helena hardcastle i say leaning forward with my hands clasped between my knees
she was there wasnt she
like alf miller said
everybody believes the family gave you a plantation for trying to save the little boy but i know thats not what happened
youve been blackmailing helena hardcastle for nineteen years ever since the boy died
you saw something that morning something youve held over her all this time
she told her husband the money was to keep cunninghams real parentage secret but thats not it is it
its something bigger  and if i dont tell you what i saw what then he snarls throwing the boot aside
you spread word that lucy harpers old man is the infamous ted stanwin and wait to see who kills her first  i open my mouth to respond only to be confounded when no words come out
of course that was my plan but sitting here im reminded of that moment on the staircase when lucy led a confused butler back into the kitchen so he wouldnt get into trouble
unlike her father shes got a good heart knotted with tenderness and doubt – perfect for men like me to step on
no wonder stanwin stayed out of sight letting her mother raise her
he probably funnelled his family a little money over the years intending to make them comfortable until he could put them permanently beyond the reach of his powerful enemies
no i say as much to myself as stanwin lucy was kind to me when i needed kindness i wont put her in danger even for this  he surprises me with a smile and the regret lurking behind it
you wont get far in this house with sentiment he says
then what about common sense i ask
evelyn hardcastle is going to be murdered tonight and i think its because of something that happened nineteen years ago
seems to me its in your interest to keep evelyn alive so she can marry ravencourt and you can keep getting paid  he whistles
if thats true theres better coin to be made in knowing who was responsible but youre coming at this crooked he says emphatically
i dont need to keep getting paid
this is it for me
ive got a big payout coming then im selling the business and getting out
thats why i came to blackheath in the first place to pick up lucy and finish the deal
shes coming with me  who are you selling it to  daniel coleridge  coleridge is planning to murder you during the hunt in a few hours
how much information is that worth  stanwin is looking at me with a bright suspicion
murder me he says
weve got a square deal him and me
were going to finish our business out in the forest  the business is in two books isnt it i say
all the names crimes and payments in one written in code of course
and the cypher to decrypt it in another
you keep them separate and think that keeps you safe but it doesnt and square deal or not youll be dead in – i pull up my sleeve to check my watch – four hours at which point coleridge will have both of the books without parting with a shilling  for the first time stanwin looks uncertain
reaching over to the drawer in his bedside table he removes a pipe and a small pouch of tobacco which he packs into the pipes bowl
scraping away the excess he circles the burning match across the leaves taking a few puffs to draw the flame
by the time his attention returns to me the tobacco is burning smoke forming a halo above his illdeserving head
hows he going to do it asks stanwin out of the corner of his mouth his pipe gripped between his yellow teeth
what did you see the morning of thomas hardcastles death i ask
thats it is it
a murder for a murder  square deal i say
he spits on his hand
shake then he says
i do as he asks then light my last cigarette
the need for tobacco has come upon me slowly the way the tide nudges up a riverbank and i let the smoke fill my throat my eyes watering in pleasure
scratching his stubble stanwin begins speaking his voice thoughtful
it was a funny day that strange from the off he says adjusting the pipe in his mouth
the guests had arrived for the party but there was already a bad atmosphere around the place
arguments in the kitchen fights in the stables even the guests were at it couldnt walk past a closed door without hearing raised voices behind it  theres a wariness to him now the sense of a man unpacking a trunk filled with sharp objects
it werent much of a surprise when charlie got fired he says
hed been carrying on with lady hardcastle long as anybody could remember
secret at first
obvious later too obvious if you ask me
they wanted to be caught i reckon
dont know what got em in the end but news went around the kitchen like a pox when charlie was dismissed by lord hardcastle
we thought hed come downstairs say goodbye but we didnt hear a peep then a couple of hours later one of the maids fetches me tells me shes just seen charlie drunk as a lord wandering around the childrens bedrooms  the childrens bedrooms youre sure  thats what she said
poking his head in the doors one after another like he was looking for something  any idea what  she thought he was trying to say goodbye but they were all out playing
either way he left with a big leather bag over his shoulder  and she didnt know what was in it  not a clue
whatever it was nobody begrudged him
he was popular charlie we all liked him  stanwin sighs tipping his face to the ceiling
what happened next i prod sensing his reluctance to continue
charlie was my friend he says heavily
so i went looking for him to say goodbye more than anything else
last anybody saw he was heading to the lake so thats where i went only he wasnt there
nobody was at least thats what it looked like at first
i would have left except i saw the blood in the dirt  you followed the blood i say
aye to the edge of the lake thats when i saw the boy  he gulps drawing his hand across his face
the memorys lurked in the darkness of his mind for so long im not surprised hes having trouble dragging it into the light
everything hes become has grown out of this poisonous seed
what did you see stanwin i ask
dropping his hand from his face he looks at me as though im a priest demanding confession
at first just lady hardcastle he says
she was kneeling in the mud sobbing her heart out
there was blood everywhere
i didnt see the boy she was cradling him so tight but she turned when she heard me
shed stabbed him through the throat almost taken his head off she had  she confessed i say
i can hear the excitement in my voice
looking down i notice that my hands are clenched my body tense
im on the edge of my seat my breath held in my throat
im immediately ashamed of myself
more or less says stanwin
just kept saying it was an accident
that was it over and over again
it was an accident  so where does carver come into this i ask
he arrived later  how much later  i dont know  five minutes twenty minutes i ask
its important stanwin  not twenty ten maybe cant have been too long  did he have the bag  the bag  the brown leather bag the maid saw him take from the house
did he have it with him  no no bag he points the pipe at me
you know something dont you  i think so yes
finish your story please  carver came took me to one side
he was sober dead sober the way a man is when hes had a shock
he asked me to forget everything id seen to tell everybody hed done it
i said i wouldnt not for her not for the hardcastles but he said he loved her that itd been an accident and it was the only thing he could do for her the only thing he could give her
he reckoned he had no future anyway not after being dismissed from blackheath and having to move away from helena
he made me swear to keep her secret  which you did except you made her pay for it i say
and youd have done different would you copper he says furiously
clapped her in irons then and there betraying a promise to your friend
or would you have let her get away with it scotfree  i shake my head
i dont have an answer for him but im not interested in his pitying selfjustification
theres only two victims in this story thomas hardcastle and charlie carver a murdered child and a man who walked to the gallows to protect the woman he loved
its too late for me to help either of them but im not going to let the truth stay buried any longer
its done enough damage already
47   bushes rustle twigs cracking underfoot
daniels moving through the forest quickly making no attempt at stealth
he has no need
my other hosts are all occupied and nearly everybody else is either on the hunt or in the sun room
my heart is racing
he slipped out of the house after speaking with bell and michael in the study and ive been following him for the last fifteen minutes picking my way silently through the trees
i remember him missing the start of the hunt and having to catch up with dance and im curious what kept him
hopefully this errand will shed more light on his plans
the trees break suddenly giving way to an ugly clearing
were not far from the lake and i can just about see the water away to my right
the footmans pacing in circles like a caged animal and i have to duck behind a bush to keep from being seen
make it quick says daniel approaching him
the footman punches him on the chin
staggering backwards daniel straightens inviting a second blow with a nod of his head
this one crunches into his stomach and is followed by a cross that knocks him to the ground
more asks the footman looming over him
thats enough says daniel dabbing his split lip
dance needs to believe we fought not that you nearly killed me  theyre working together
can you catch them says the footman helping daniel off the ground
the hunters have a good head start  lot of old legs
they wont have gone far
any luck snatching anna  not yet ive been busy  well hurry up our friends getting impatient  so thats what this was all about
they want anna
thats why daniel told me to find her when i was ravencourt and why he asked derby to bring her to the library when he laid out his plan to trap the footman
i was supposed to deliver her
a lamb to slaughter
my head spinning i watch them exchange a few final words before the footman makes for the house
daniels wiping the blood from his face but he doesnt move and a second later i see why
the plague doctors entering the clearing
this must be the friend daniel mentioned
its as i feared
theyre working together
daniels formed a partnership with the footman and theyre hunting anna on the plague doctors behalf
i cant imagine whats fuelling this enmity but it explains why the plague doctors spent the day trying to turn me against her
placing a hand on daniels shoulder he leads him into the trees beyond my sight
the intimacy of this gesture throws me
i cant recall a single time when the plague doctor has touched me or even come close enough for that to happen
keeping low i hurry after them stopping at the treeline to listen for their voices but i cant hear anything
cursing i press deeper into the forest stopping periodically hoping to catch some sign of them
its no use
theyre gone
feeling like a man in a dream i return the way i came
everything i saw that day how much of it was real
was anybody who they claimed to be
i believed daniel and evelyn were my friends the plague doctor was a madman and that i was a doctor called sebastian bell whose biggest problem was memory loss
how could i know those were merely starting positions in a race nobody had told me i was running
its the finishing line you should be concerned with
the graveyard i say out loud
daniel believes hell capture anna there and i have no doubt hell have the footman with him when he tries
thats where this will end and i need to be ready
ive arrived at the wishing well where evelyn received the note from felicity that first morning
im eager to put my plan into action but instead of heading for the house i instead turn left towards the lake
this is rashtons doing
its instinct
a coppers instinct
he wants to see the scene of the crime while stanwins testimony is still fresh in my mind
the trail is overgrown trees leaning in on either side their roots writhing up through the ground
brambles snag my trench coat rain spilling off leaves until finally i emerge on the lakes muddy banks
ive only ever seen it at a distance but its much bigger up close with water the colour of mossy stone and a couple of skeletal rowing boats tethered to a boathouse thats crumbling to firewood on the farright bank
a bandstand sits on an island at the centre the peeling turquoise roof and wooden frame battered by the wind and rain
no wonder the hardcastles chose to leave blackheath
something evil happened here and it haunts the lake still
such is my unease i almost turn on my heel but a greater part of me needs to make sense of what happened here nineteen years ago and so i walk the length of the lake circling it twice much as a coroner might circle a body on his slab
an hour passes
my eyes are busy but they stick to nothing
stanwins story seems cut and dried but it doesnt explain why the past is reaching up to claim another hardcastle child
it doesnt explain whos behind it or what they hope to gain
i thought coming here would bring some clarity but whatever the lake remembers it has little interest in sharing
unlike stanwin it cannot be bartered with and unlike the stablemaster it cannot be bullied
cold and wet i might be tempted to give up but rashton is already tugging me towards the reflecting pool
the policemans eyes arent soft like my other hosts
they seek the edges the absences
my memories of this place arent enough for him he needs to see it all afresh
and so hands deep in my pockets i arrange myself at the edge of the water which is high enough to touch the bottom of my shoes
a light rain is rippling the surface plinking against thick patches of floating moss
at least the rain is constant
its tapping bells face as he walks with evelyn and the windows of the gatehouse where the butler sleeps and gold is strung up
ravencourts listening to it in his parlour wondering where cunningham has got to and derby well derbys still unconscious which is the best thing for him
davies is collapsed on the road or maybe walking back
either way hes getting wet
as is dance whos traipsing through the forest a shotgun slung over his arm wishing he was anywhere else
as for me im standing exactly where evelyn will stand tonight where shell press a silver pistol to her stomach and pull the trigger
im seeing what shell see
trying to understand
the murderer found a way to force evelyn to commit suicide but why not have her shoot herself in her bedroom out of sight
why bring her out here during the middle of the party
so everybody would see
then why not the middle of the dance floor or the stage i mutter
all this its too theatrical
rashtons worked on dozens of murders
they arent stagemanaged theyre immediate impulsive acts
men crawl into their cups after a hard days work stirring the bitterness settled at the bottom
fights break out wives grow tired of their black eyes and pick up the nearest kitchen knife
death happens in alleys and quiet rooms with doilies on the tables
trees fall people are crushed tools slip
people die the way theyve always died quickly impatiently or unluckily not here not in front of a hundred people in ball gowns and dinner jackets
what kind of mind makes theatre of murder
turning back towards the house i try to recall evelyns route to the reflecting pool remembering how she drifted from flame to darkness wobbling as if drunk
i remember the silver pistol glinting in her hand the shot the silence and then the fireworks as she tumbled into the water
why take two guns when one will do
a murder that doesnt look like a murder
thats how the plague doctor described it but what if my mind gropes at the edges of a thought teasing it forward out of the dimness
an idea emerges the queerest of ideas
the only one that makes sense
im startled by a tap on my shoulder almost sending me stumbling into the reflecting pool
thankfully grace catches hold of me pulling me back into her arms
its not i must admit an unpleasant predicament especially when i turn around to meet those blue eyes looking up at me with a mixture of love and bemusement
what on earth are you doing out here she asks
ive been searching for you all over
you missed lunch  theres concern in her voice
she holds my gaze searching my eyes though i have no idea what shes looking for
i came for a walk i say trying to slip free of her worry
and i started imagining what this place must have been like in its pomp  doubt flickers on her face but it vanishes in a blink of her glorious eyes as she slips an arm through mine the heat of her body warming me up
its difficult to remember now she says
every memory i have of this place even the happy ones are stained by what happened to thomas  were you here when it happened  have i never told you this she says resting her head on my shoulder
i suppose i wouldnt have i was only young
yes i was here nearly everybody here today was  did you see it  thank heavens no she says aghast
evelyn had arranged a treasure hunt for the children
i cant have been more than seven same for thomas
evelyn was ten
she was all grown up so we were her responsibility for the day  she grows distant distracted by a memory taking flight
of course now i know she just wanted to go riding and not have to look after us but at the time we thought her terribly kind
we were having a jolly time chasing each other through the forest looking for clues when all of a sudden thomas bolted off
we never saw him again  bolted
did he say why he was leaving or where he was going  you sound like the policeman who questioned me she says hugging me closer
no he didnt hang around for questions
he asked after the time and left  he asked the time  yes it was like he had somewhere to be  and he didnt tell you where he was going  no  was he acting strangely did he say anything odd  actually we could barely get a word out of him she says
hed been in a strange mood all week come to think of it withdrawn sulky not like him at all  what was he normally like  she shrugs
a pest most of the time
he was at that age
he liked to tug our ponytails and scare us
hed follow us through the woods then jump out when we least expected it  but hed been acting strangely for a week i say
are you certain thats how long it had been  well thats how long we were at blackheath before the party so yes shes shivering now peering up at me
whats that mind of yours got hold of mr rashton she asks
got hold of  i can see the little crease – she taps the spot between my eyebrows – you get when somethings bothering you  im not sure yet  well try not to do it when you meet grandmother  crease my forehead  think silly  why the heavens not  she doesnt take kindly to young men who think too much
she believes its a sign of idleness  the temperature is dropping quickly
what little colour was left to the day is fleeing the dark storm clouds bullying the sky
shall we go back to the house says grace stamping her feet to warm up
i dislike blackheath as much as the next girl but not so much that im willing to freeze to death to avoid going back inside it  i glance at the reflecting pool a little forlornly but i cant press my idea without speaking to evelyn first and shes out walking with bell
whatever my minds got hold of – to use graces phrase – itll have to keep until she returns in a couple of hours
besides the idea of spending time with somebody who isnt mired in todays many tragedies is appealing
our shoulders pressed together we make our way back to the house arriving in the entrance hall in time to see charles cunningham trotting down the steps
hes frowning lost in thought
are you quite all right charles says grace drawing his attention
honestly what is it with the men in this house today
youre all on a cloud  a grin cracks his face his joy at seeing us quite at odds with the seriousness with which he normally greets me
ah my two favourite people he says grandly leaping from the third step to clap us both on the shoulder
im sorry i was miles away  affection draws a huge smile on my face
until now the valet was simply somebody who flitted in and out of my day occasionally helpful but always pursuing some purpose of his own making him impossible to trust
seeing him through rashtons eyes is like watching a charcoal outline get coloured in
grace and donald davies summered at blackheath growing up side by side with michael evelyn thomas and cunningham
despite being raised by the cook mrs drudge everybody believed he was peter hardcastles son by birth and this elevated him beyond the kitchen
encouraging this perception helena hardcastle instructed the governess to educate cunningham with the hardcastle children
he may have become a servant but neither grace nor donald would ever see him as such no matter what their parents might say
the three of them are practically family which is why cunningham was one of the first people donald davies introduced rashton to when they returned from the war
the three of them are as close as brothers
is ravencourt being a nuisance asks grace
you didnt forget his second helping of eggs again did you
you know how disagreeable that makes him  no no its not that cunningham shakes his head thoughtfully
you know how sometimes your day starts as one thing and then just like that its something else
ravencourt told me something rather startling and to tell you the truth i still havent wrapped my head around it  what did he say asks grace cocking her head
that hes not he trails off pinching his nose
thinking better of it he sighs dismissing the entire line of conversation
best i tell you this evening over a brandy when everythings shaken out
not sure i have the words just yet  its always the same with you charles she says stamping her foot
you enjoy starting juicy stories but you never finish them  well maybe this will improve your mood  from his pocket he produces a silver key a cardboard tag identifying it as sebastian bells
the last time i saw that key it was in the vile derbys pocket shortly before somebody coshed him over the head outside stanwins bedroom and stole it
i can feel myself being slotted into place a cog in a massive ticking clock propelling a mechanism im too small to understand
you found it for me says grace clapping her hands together
he beams at me
grace asked me snatch a spare key to bells bedroom from the kitchen so we could steal his drugs he says dangling the key from his finger
i went one better and found the key to his trunk  its childish but i want bell to suffer the way donald is suffering she says her eyes glittering viciously
and how did you come by the key i ask cunningham
in the course of my duties he says a little uneasily
ive got his bedroom key in my pocket
all those little vials dropped in the lake can you imagine  not the lake says grace making a face
its bad enough coming back to blackheath but i wont go anywhere near that awful place  theres the well i say out by the gatehouse
its old and deep
if we drop the drugs down there nobody will ever find them  perfect says cunningham rubbing his hands together gleefully
well the good doctor has gone for a walk with miss hardcastle so i should say this is as good a time as any
whos up for a little daylight robbery      48   grace keeps watch by the door as cunningham and i slip into bells bedroom nostalgia painting everything in cheerful colours
after wrestling with the domineering natures of my other hosts my attitude towards bell has softened considerably
unlike derby ravencourt or rashton sebastian bell was a blank canvas a man in retreat even from himself
i poured into him filling the empty spaces so completely i didnt even realise he was the wrong shape
in an odd way he feels like an old friend
where do you think he keeps the stuff cunningham asks closing the door behind us
though i know perfectly well where bells trunk is i feign ignorance giving myself the opportunity to wade about in his absence for a little while enjoying the sensation of walking back into a life i once inhabited
cunningham uncovers the trunk soon enough though engaging my help to drag it out of the wardrobe making a terrible racket as he scrapes it on the wooden floorboards
its as well everybodys hunting as the noise could wake the dead
the key fits perfectly the latch springing open on welloiled hinges to reveal an interior stuffed to bursting with brown vials and bottles arranged in neat rows
cunningham has brought a cotton sack and kneeling either side of the trunk we begin filling it with bells stash
there are tinctures and concoctions of every sort and not merely those designed to put a foolish smile on the face
among the dubious pleasures is a halfempty flask of strychnine the white grains looking for all the world like large chunks of salt
now whats he doing with that
bell will sell anything to anyone wont he says cunningham with a tut plucking the flask from my hand and dropping it into the sack
not for much longer though  plucking the bottles from the trunk i remember the note gold pushed under my door and the three things it demanded i pilfer
thankfully cunninghams so enraptured by his task he doesnt notice me slipping the bottles into my pocket or the chess piece i drop into the trunk
amid all the plots it seems an inconsequential thing to bother with but i can still remember how much comfort it brought me how much strength
it was a kindness when i needed one most and it cheers me to be the one delivering it
charles i need you to tell me the truth about something i begin
ive told you im not getting between you and grace he says distantly carefully filling his sack
whatever youre arguing about this week admit youre wrong and be grateful when she accepts your apology  he flashes me a grin but it evaporates when he sees my grim expression
whats wrong he asks
where did you get the key to the trunk i reply
if you must know one of the servants gave it to me he says avoiding my gaze as he continues to pack
no they didnt i say scratching my neck
you took it off jonathan derbys body after you coshed him over the head
daniel coleridge hired you to steal stanwins blackmail ledger didnt he  th thats nonsense he says
please charles i say my voice rough with emotion
ive already spoken with stanwin  rashton has counted on cunninghams friendship and counsel many times over the years and watching him squirm under the spotlight of my questioning is unbearable
i
i didnt mean to hit him says cunningham shamefaced
id just put ravencourt into his bath and was going for my breakfast when i heard a commotion on the stairs
i saw derby hare into the study with stanwin on his tail
i thought i could slip into stanwins room while everybody was distracted and grab the ledger but the bodyguard was in there so i hid in one of the rooms opposite waiting to see what would happen  you saw dickie give the bodyguard a sedative and then derby find the ledger i say
you couldnt let him walk out of there with it
it was too valuable  cunningham nods eagerly
stanwin knows what happened that morning he knows who really killed thomas he says
hes been lying all this time
its in that ledger of his
coleridge is going to decipher it for me and then everybody will know my father my real father is innocent  fear swells in his eyes
does stanwin know about the bargain i struck with coleridge he asks suddenly
is that why you met with him  he doesnt know anything i say gently
i went to ask about thomas hardcastles murder  and he told you  he owed me for saving his life  cunningham is still on his knees his hands gripping my shoulders
youre a miracle worker rasher he says
dont leave me in suspense  he saw lady hardcastle covered in blood and cradling thomass body i say watching him closely
stanwin drew the obvious conclusion but carver arrived some minutes later and insisted stanwin place the blame on him  cunningham stares through me as he tries to pick holes in an answer long sought
when he speaks again theres bitterness in his voice
of course he says sagging to the floor
ive spent years trying to prove my father was innocent so naturally i find out that my mothers the murderer instead  how long have you known who your real parents are i say doing my best to sound consoling
mother told me when i turned twentyone he says
she said my father wasnt the monster he was accused of being but would never explain why
ive spent every day since then trying to work out what she meant  you saw her this morning didnt you  i took her tea he says gently
she drank it in bed while we spoke
i used to do the same thing when i was a child
shed ask after my happiness my education
she was kind to me
it was my favourite time of the day  and this morning
i assume she didnt mention anything suspicious  about murdering thomas
no it didnt come up he says sarcastically
i meant anything out of character unusual  out of character he snorts
shes barely been in character for a year or more
cant keep up with her
one minute shes giddy the next shes in tears  a year i say thoughtfully
ever since she visited blackheath on the anniversary of thomass death  it was after that visit she turned up on michaels doorstep raving about clothes
yes maybe he says tugging an earlobe
i say you dont think it all got on top of her do you
the guilt i mean
that would explain why shes been acting so queer
maybe shes been building up her courage to finally confess
it would certainly make sense of her mood this morning  why what did you speak about  she was calm actually
a touch distant
she talked about putting things right and how she was sorry id had to grow up ashamed of my fathers name his face falls
thats it isnt it
she means to confess at the party tonight
thats why shes gone to all this trouble to reopen blackheath and invite the same guests back  maybe i say unable to keep my doubt from surfacing
why were your fingerprints all over her planner
what were you looking for  when i pressed her for more information she asked me to look up what time she was meeting the stablemaster
she said shed be able to tell me more after that and i should come by the stables
i waited but she never arrived
ive been looking for her all day but nobodys seen her
maybe shes gone to the village  i ignore that
tell me about the stable hand who went missing i say
you asked the stablemaster about him  nothing to tell really
a few years back i got drunk with the inspector who investigated thomass murder
he never believed my father – carver i mean – did it mainly because this other boy keith parker had gone missing a week earlier while my father was in london with lord hardcastle and he didnt like the coincidence
the inspector asked around after the boy but nothing came of it
by all accounts parker upped and left without a word to anybody and never came back
they never found a body so couldnt disprove the rumour that hed run away  did you know him  vaguely he used to play with us sometimes but even the servants children had jobs to do around the house
he worked in the stables most of the time
we rarely saw him  catching my mood he looks at me inquisitively
do you really think my mothers a murderer he says
thats what i need your help to find out i say
your mother entrusted mrs drudge to raise you yes
does that mean they were close  very close mrs drudge was the only other person who knew about my real father before stanwin found out  good im going to need a favour  what sort of favour  two favours actually i say
i need mrs drudge to oh  ive just caught up to my past
the answer to a question i was about to ask has already been delivered to me
now i need to make sure it happens again
cunningham waves a hand in front of my face
you quite all right rasher
you seem to have come over a bit queer  sorry old chap i got distracted i say batting away his confusion
as i was saying i need mrs drudge to clear something up for me and then i need you to gather a few people together
when youre done find jonathan derby and tell him everything youve discovered  derby
whats that scoundrel got to do with this  the door opens grace poking her head inside the room
for heavens sake whats taking so long she asks
if we wait any longer were going to have to run bell a bath and pretend were servants  one more minute i say laying my hand on cunninghams arm
were going to put this right i promise you
now listen closely this is important      49   the cotton sack clinks as we walk its weight conspiring with the uneven ground to continually trip me up grace wincing in sympathy at each stumble
cunninghams run off to do my favour grace meeting his sudden departure with puzzled silence
i feel the urge to explain but rashton knows this woman well enough to know its not expected
ten minutes after donald davies introduced his grateful family to the man whod saved his life during the war it was clear to anybody with eyes and a heart that jim rashton and grace davies would one day be married
undaunted by their different backgrounds they spent that first dinner building a bridge out of affectionate barbs and probing questions love blossoming across a table littered with cutlery rashton couldnt identify
what was born that day has only grown since the two of them coming to inhabit a world of their own making
grace knows ill tell the story when its finished when its shored up with facts strong enough to support the telling
in the meantime we walk together in a companionable silence happy just to be in each others company
im wearing my brass knuckles having vaguely mentioned a threat from bell and doctor dickies confederates
its a weak lie but its enough to keep grace on her toes the young woman glaring suspiciously at every dripping leaf
so it is that we come upon the well grace pushing aside a tree branch that i might emerge into the clearing without becoming snagged
i immediately drop the sack into the well where it hits the bottom with a tremendous crash
waggling my arms i try to shake the ache from my muscles while grace peers into the wells darkness
any wishes she asks
that i dont have to carry the sack back i say
oh my heavens it really works she says
do you think i can wish for more wishes  sounds like cheating to me  well nobodys used it for years theres probably a few going spare  may i ask you a question i reply
never known you to be shy about them she says leaning so far into the well her feet are in the air
the morning of thomass murder when you went on the scavenger hunt who was with you  come on jim it was nineteen years ago she says her voice muffled by the stone
was charles there  charles she removes her head from the well
yes probably  probably or actually
its important grace  i can see that she says pulling herself clear and wiping her hands
has he done something wrong  i really hope not  so do i she says mirroring my concern
let me think
wait a tick yes he was there
he stole an entire fruitcake from the kitchen i remember him giving me and donald some
must have driven mrs drudge wild  what about michael hardcastle was he there  michael
why i dont know  a hand goes to a curl of hair twisting it around her finger while she thinks
its a familiar gesture one that fills rashton with such an overpowering love its almost enough to push me aside completely
he was in bed i think she says eventually
sick with something or other one of those childish things  she takes my hand in both of her own holding me fast in those beautiful blue eyes
are you doing something dangerous jim she asks
yes  are you doing it for charles  partly  will you ever tell me about it  yes when i know what needs to be said  standing on her tiptoes she kisses me on the nose
then youd better get going she says rubbing her lipstick off my skin
i know what youre like when youve got a bone to dig up and you wont be happy until you have it  thank you  say it with the story and say it soon  i will i say
its rashton who kisses her now
when i do wrestle this body back from him im flushed and embarrassed grace grinning at me with a wicked glint in her eye
its all i can do to leave her there but for the first time since this began i have my hands around the truth and unless i dig my fingers in im worried itll slip free
i need to talk to anna
i make my way along the cobbled path around the rear of the gatehouse shaking the rain from my trench coat before hanging it on the rack in the kitchen
footsteps echo through the floor heartbeats in the wood
a commotions coming from the sitting room on my right the place where dance and his cronies met peter hardcastle this morning
my first assumption is that one of them has returned but opening the door i find anna standing over peter hardcastle whos slumped in the same chair i found him in earlier
hes dead
anna i say quietly
she turns to greet me shock on her face
i heard a noise and came down she says gesturing at the body
unlike myself shes not spent the day wading through blood and finding a body has hit her hard
why dont you go splash some water on your face i say touching her lightly on the arm
ill have a nose around  she nods at me gratefully offering the body one last lingering look before hurrying out of the room
i cant say i blame her
his once handsome features are frightfully twisted his right eye barely open his left eye fully exposed
his hands are gripping the arms of the chair his back arched in pain
whatever happened here took his dignity and his life at the same time
my first thought would be heart attack but rashtons instincts make me cautious
i reach out to close his eyes but cant bring myself to touch him
with so few hosts left id rather not tempt deaths gaze back towards me
theres a folded letter sticking out of his top pocket and plucking it free i read the message inside
i couldnt marry ravencourt and i couldnt forgive my family for making me do so
they brought this on themselves
evelyn hardcastle  a draught is blowing in through an open window
mud smears the frame suggesting somebody made their escape through it
about the only note of disturbance i can see is a drawer thats been left hanging open
its the one i rifled through as dance and sure enough peters organiser is missing
first somebody tore a page out of helenas planner and now theyve taken peters
something helena did today is worth killing to cover up
thats useful information
horrific but useful
putting the letter in my pocket i poke my head out of the window looking for some evidence of the murderers identity
theres not much to see aside from a few footsteps in the dirt already washing away in the rain
from their shape and size whoever fled the gatehouse was a woman in pointed boots which might give the note some credence except that i know evelyn is with bell
she couldnt have done this
i take a seat opposite peter hardcastle as dance did this morning
despite the late hour the memory of that gathering is still about the room
the glasses we drank from havent been removed from the table and the cigar smoke still hangs in the air
hardcastles wearing the same clothes i last saw him in meaning he never got changed for the hunt so its likely hes been dead for a couple of hours
one by one i dab my finger into the dregs of the drinks tasting each of them with the tip of my tongue
theyre all fine except for lord hardcastles
behind the charred whisky lies a subtle bitter taste
rashton recognises it immediately
strychnine i say staring into the victims twisted smiling face
he looks delighted by the news as though hes sat here all this time waiting for somebody to tell him how he died
hed probably also want to know who killed him
i have an idea about that but for the moment an ideas all it is
is he telling you anything asks anna passing me a towel
shes still a little pale but her voice is stronger suggesting shes recovered from her initial shock
even so she keeps her distance from the body arms wrapped tight around herself
somebody poisoned him with strychnine i say
bell supplied it  bell
your first host
you think hes tied up in all of this  not willingly i say drying my hair
hes too much of a coward to tangle himself up in murder
strychnine is often sold in small quantities as rat poison
if the killer was part of the household they could have requested a significant amount under the guise of getting blackheath up and running
bell would have no reason to be suspicious until the bodies started appearing
that probably explains why somebody tried to kill him  how do you know all of this says anna astonished
rashton knows it i say tapping my forehead
he worked on a strychnine case a few years back
nasty business
matter of inheritance  and you can just remember it  i nod still thinking through the implications of the poisoning
somebody lured bell out to the forest last night intending to silence him i say to myself
but the good doctor managed to escape with only the injuries to his arms losing his pursuer in the darkness
lucky fellow  annas looking at me strangely
whats wrong i say frowning
its the way you were speaking – she falters – it wasnt
i didnt recognise you
aiden how much of you is still in there  enough i say impatiently handing her the letter i found in hardcastles pocket
you should see this
somebody wants us to believe this is evelyns doing
the murderers trying to wrap it all up in a nice little bow  she drags her gaze away from me and reads the letter
what if weve been looking at this all wrong she says after shes finished
what if somebody means to knock off the entire hardcastle family and evelyn is just the first  you think helenas hiding  if shes got any sense thats exactly what shes doing  i let my mind bat the idea around for a while trying to see it from every angle
or at least i try
its too heavy
too ponderous
i cant see what could be on the other side
what do we next she asks
i need you to tell evelyn that the butlers awake and that he needs to speak with her privately i say getting to my feet
but the butler isnt awake and he doesnt want to speak with her  no but i do and id rather stay out of the footmans crosshairs if i can  of course ill go but you need to watch the butler and gold in my place she says
i will  and what are you going to say to evelyn when she gets here  im going to tell her how she dies      50   its 542 pm and anna hasnt returned
its been over three hours since she left
three hours of fidgeting and worrying the shotgun laid across my lap leaping into my hands at the slightest noise making it a nearconstant presence in my arms
i dont know how anna did it
this place is never at rest
the wind claws its way through the cracks in the windows howling up and down the corridor
timbers creak floorboards stretch shifting under their own weight as though the gatehouse were an old man trying to rise out of his chair
time and again i heard steps approaching only to open the door and find id been tricked by the banging of a loose shutter or a tree branch rapping on the window
but these noises have stopped provoking any reaction in me because i no longer believe my friend is coming back
an hour into my vigil i reassured myself she was simply struggling to locate evelyn following her walk with bell
after two hours i reasoned she might be running errands – a theory i tried to confirm by piecing together her day from our previous encounters
by her own account she met gold first derby in the forest and then dance before collecting me from the attic
after that she talked with the butler for the first time in the carriage on the way here left the note for bell in the stablemasters cottage and then sought out ravencourt in his parlour
there was another conversation with the butler after that but it wasnt until the footman attacked dance in the evening that i saw her again
for six days shes been disappearing every afternoon and i havent noticed
now passing my third hour in this room darkness pressing against the glass im certain shes in trouble and that the footmans lurking somewhere behind it
having seen her with our enemy i know shes alive though thats cold comfort
whatever the footman did to gold broke his mind and i cannot bear the thought of anna undergoing similar torment
shotgun in hand i pace the room trying to stay one step ahead of my dread long enough to come up with a plan
the easiest thing would be to wait here knowing the footman will come for the butler eventually but in doing so id waste the hours i need to solve evelyns murder
and what use is saving anna if i cant free her from this house
as desperate as i feel i must first attend to evelyn and trust anna to take care of herself while i do so
the butler whimpers his eyes fluttering open
for a moment we simply stare at each other trading guilt and confusion
by leaving him and gold unguarded im condemning them to madness and death but i can see no other way
as he falls asleep i lay the shotgun on the bed by his side
ive seen him die but i dont have to accept it
my conscience demands i give him a fighting chance at the very least
snatching my coat off the chair i depart for blackheath without a backward glance
evelyns messy bedroom is exactly as i left it the fire burned so low theres barely any light to see by
adding a few logs i begin my search
my hand is shaking though this time its not derbys lust at work its my own excitement
if i find what im looking for ill know whos responsible for evelyns death
freedom will be within touching distance
derby may have searched this room earlier but he had neither rashtons training nor his experience
the constables hands immediately seek out hiding spots behind cabinets and around the bedframe my feet tapping the floorboards in hopes of locating a loose panel
even so after a thorough search i come up empty
theres nothing
turning on the spot my eyes sweep the furnishings searching for something ive missed
i cant be wrong about the suicide no other explanation makes sense
thats when my gaze alights on the tapestry concealing the communicating door into helenas bedroom
taking an oil lamp i pass through repeating my search
ive almost given up hope when i lift the mattress off the bed and find a cotton bag tied to one of the bars
unpicking the drawstring i find two guns inside
one is a harmless starting pistol the stalwart of village fêtes everywhere
the other is the black revolver evelyn took from her mothers room the one she had in the forest this morning and will carry into the graveyard this evening
its loaded
a single bullet missing from the chamber
theres also a vial of blood and a small syringe filled with a clear liquid
my heart is racing
i was right i mutter
its the stirring of the curtains that saves my life
the breeze from the opened door touches my neck an instant before a step sounds behind me
throwing myself to the floor i hear a knife slashing through the air
rolling onto my back i bring the revolver up in time to see the footman fleeing into the corridor
letting my head drop onto the floorboards i rest the gun on my stomach and thank my lucky stars
if id noticed the curtains a second later this would all be over
i give myself a chance to recover my breath then get to my feet replacing the two weapons and the syringe in the bag but taking the vial of blood
cautiously departing the bedroom i ask around for evelyn until somebody points me towards the ballroom which is echoing with loud banging a stage being finished by builders
the french doors have been thrown open in hopes of evacuating the paint fumes and dust maids scrubbing their youth away on the floor
i spot evelyn by the stage speaking with the bandleader
shes still in the green dress she wears during the day but madeline aubert is standing behind her with a mouthful of pins hurriedly jabbing them into escaping locks of hair trying to fashion the style shell wear tonight
miss hardcastle i call out crossing the room
dismissing the bandleader with a friendly smile and a squeeze of the arm she turns towards me
evelyn please she says holding out her hand
and you are  jim rashton  ah yes the policeman she says her smile vanishing
is everything well
you look a little flushed  im not used to the hustle and bustle of polite society i say
i shake her hand lightly surprised by how cold it is
how can i help you mr rashton she asks
her voice is distant almost annoyed
i feel like a squashed insect shes discovered on the bottom of her shoe
as with ravencourt im struck by the disdain with which evelyn armours herself
of all blackheaths tricks being exposed to every unpleasant side of a person you once considered a friend is surely the cruellest
the thought brings me pause
evelyn was kind to bell and the memory of that kindness has driven me ever since but the plague doctor said hed experimented with different combinations of hosts over many different loops
if ravencourt had been my first host as he surely was at some point id have known nothing of evelyn beyond her contempt
derby drew only anger and i doubt shed have spared any kindness for servants like the butler or gold
that means there were loops where i watched this woman die and felt almost nothing about it my only concern being to solve her murder rather than desperately trying to prevent it
i almost envy them
may i speak with you – i glance at madeline – privately  i really am awfully busy she says
whats this about  id prefer to speak privately  and id prefer to finish getting this ballroom ready before fifty people arrive and find theres nowhere for them to dance she says sharply
you can imagine which preference im giving greater weight to  madeline smirks and pins another lock of evelyns loose hair into place
very well i say producing the vial of blood i found in the cotton sack
lets talk about this  i might as well have slapped her but the shock slides off her face so quickly i have trouble believing it was ever there
well finish this later maddie says evelyn fixing me with a cool level stare
go down to the kitchen and get yourself some food  madelines gaze is equally mistrusting but she drops the pins into her apron pocket before curtsying and leaving the room
taking me by the arm evelyn leads me towards the corner of the ballroom far from the ears of the servants
is it your habit to root through peoples personal possessions mr rashton she asks taking a cigarette from her case
lately yes i say
maybe you need a hobby  i have a hobby im trying to save your life  my life doesnt need saving she says coolly
perhaps you should try gardening instead  or perhaps i should fake a suicide so i dont have to marry lord ravencourt i say pausing to enjoy the collapse of her supercilious expression
that seems to be keeping you busy lately
its very clever unfortunately somebodys going to use that fake suicide to murder you which is a great deal cleverer  her mouth hangs open her blue eyes sick with surprise
averting her glance she tries to light the cigarette held between her fingers but her hand is trembling
i take the match from her and light it myself the flame singeing my fingertips
who put you up to this she hisses
what are you talking about  my plan she says snatching the vial of blood from my hand
who told you about it  why who else is involved i ask
i know you invited somebody called felicity to the house but i dont know who that is yet  shes she shakes her head
nothing i shouldnt even be talking to you  she turns for the door but i catch her by the wrist pulling her back rather more forcefully than id intended
anger flashes on her face and i immediately release her raising my hands
ted stanwin told me everything i say desperately trying to keep her from storming out of the room
i need a plausible explanation for the things i know and derby overheard stanwin and evelyn arguing this morning
if im very lucky the blackmailer has a hand in all of this
its not much of a stretch
he has a hand in everything else thats happening today
evelyns still watchful like a deer in the woods thats just heard a branch snap
he said you were planning to kill yourself by the reflecting pool this evening but that made no sense i press on trusting to stanwins formidable reputation to sell the story
forgive me for being blunt miss hardcastle but if you were serious about ending your life youd already be dead not playing the dutiful hostess to people you despise
my second idea was that you wanted everybody to see it happen but then why not do it in the ballroom during the party
i couldnt make sense of it until i stood on the edge of the reflecting pool and realised how dark it was how easily it could conceal something dropped into it  scorn glitters in her eyes
and what is it you want mr rashton
money  im trying to help you i insist
i know you intend to go to the reflecting pool at 11 pm press a black revolver to your stomach and collapse into the pool
i know you wont actually pull the trigger of the black revolver and a starters pistol will make the sound of the gunshot everybody hears just as i know you plan to drop the starters pistol into the water when youre done
the vial of blood will be hung from a long cord around your neck and will crack open when you hit it with the revolver providing the gore
im guessing the syringe i found in the sack is filled with some combination of muscle relaxant and sedative to help you play dead making it easy for doctor dickie – who i assume is being paid handsomely for his trouble – to make it official on the death certificate forgoing the need for an unpleasant inquest
one would imagine that a week or so after your death youll be back in france enjoying a nice glass of white wine  a couple of maids are carrying slopping buckets of dirty water towards the doors their gossip coming to an abrupt halt as they notice us
they pass by with uncertain dips evelyn steering me further into the corner
for the first time i see fear on her face
i admit i didnt want to marry ravencourt and i knew i couldnt keep my family from forcing me into it unless i disappeared but why would anybody want to kill me she asks the cigarette still trembling in her hand
i study her face for a lie but i might as well be turning a microscope on a patch of fog
this woman has been lying to everybody for days
i wouldnt recognise the truth even if it did manage to escape her lips
i have certain suspicions but i need proof i say
thats why i need you to go through with your plan  go through with it are you mad she exclaims lowering her voice as all eyes turn towards us
why would i go through with it after what youve just told me  because you wont be safe until we draw the conspirators out and for that they need to believe their plan has succeeded  ill be safe when im a hundred miles from here  and how will you get there i ask
what happens if the carriage driver is part of the plot or a servant
whispers carry in this house and when the murderers get word youre trying to leave theyll push forward with their plan and kill you
believe me running will only delay the inevitable
i can put a stop to it here and now but only if you go along with it all
point a gun at your stomach and play dead for half an hour
who knows you may even get to stay dead and escape ravencourt as you planned  she has her hand pressed to her forehead eyes squeezed shut in concentration
when she speaks again its in a quieter voice somehow emptier
im caught between the devil and the deepblue sea arent i she says
very well ill go through with it but theres something i need to know first
why are you helping me mr rashton  im a policeman  yes but youre not a saint and only a saint would put themselves in the middle of all this  then consider it a favour to sebastian bell i say
surprise softens her expression
bell
what on earth has the dear doctor got to do with this  i dont know yet but he was attacked last night and i doubt its a coincidence  perhaps but why is that your concern  he wants to be a better person i say
thats a rare thing in this house
i admire it  as do i she says pausing to weigh up the man in front of her
very well tell me your plan but first i want your word that ill be safe
im putting my life in your hands and thats not something i submit to without guarantee  how do you know my word is worth anything  ive been around dishonourable men my entire life she says simply
youre not one of them
now give me your word  you have it  and a drink she continues
im going to need a little courage to see this through  more than a little i say
i want you to befriend jonathan derby
he has a silver pistol well be needing      51   dinners being served the guests taking their seats at the table as i crouch in the bushes near the reflecting pool
its early but my plan depends on being the first person to reach evelyn when she emerges from the house
i cant risk the past tripping me up
rain drips from the leaves icy cold on my skin
the wind stirs my legs cramping
shifting my weight i realise i havent eaten or taken a drink all day which isnt ideal preparation for the evening ahead
im lightheaded and without anything to distract me i can feel every one of my hosts pressed up against the inside of my skull
their memories crowd the edges of my mind the weight of them almost too much to bear
i want everything they want
i feel their aches and am made timid by their fears
im no longer a man im a chorus
oblivious to my presence two servants spill out of the house their arms laden with wood for the braziers oil lamps hanging from their belts
one by one they ignite the braziers drawing a line of fire into the pitchblack evening
the last one is next to the greenhouse the flames reflecting on the glass panels so that the entire thing seems to be ablaze
as the wind howls and the trees drip blackheath flickers and changes following the guests as they make their way from the dining hall to their bedrooms and finally into the ballroom where the band have taken to the stage and the evening guests await
servants open the french doors music exploding outwards tumbling across the ground and into the forest
now you see them as i do says the plague doctor in a low voice
actors in a play doing the same thing night after night  hes standing behind me mostly obscured by trees and bushes
in the uncertain light of the brazier his mask appears to float in the gloom like a soul trying to tug free of its body
did you tell the footman about anna i hiss
its taking every ounce of selfcontrol i have not to leap up and throttle him
i have no interest in either of them he says flatly
i saw you outside the gatehouse with daniel then again near the lake and now annas missing i say
did you tell him where to find her  for the first time the plague doctor sounds uncertain
i assure you i wasnt at either of those locations mr bishop  i saw you i growl
you spoke with him  it wasnt he trails off and when he speaks again its with a spark of understanding
so thats how hes been doing it
i wondered how he knew so much  daniel lied to me from the start and you kept his secret  it isnt my place to interfere
i knew youd see through him eventually  so why warn him about anna  because i worried that you wouldnt  the music stops sharply and checking my watch i discover its a few minutes before eleven
michael hardcastle has silenced the orchestra to ask if anybodys seen his sister
theres movement by the side of the house darkness stirred by darkness as derby takes his position by the rock following annas instructions
i wasnt in that clearing mr bishop i promise you says the plague doctor
ill explain everything soon but for the moment i have my own investigation to undertake  he departs quickly leaving only questions in his wake
if this were any other host id run after him but rashtons a subtler creature slow to startle quick to think
for the moment evelyns my only concern
i put the plague doctor out of my thoughts and creep closer to the reflecting pool
thankfully the leaves and twigs are so demoralised by the earlier rain they dont have the heart to cry out beneath my feet
evelyns approaching sobbing looking for me in the trees
whatever her involvement in all this shes clearly afraid her entire body shaking
she must have already taken the muscle relaxant because shes swaying slightly as though moved by some music only she can hear
i rustle a nearby bush to let her know im here but the drugs doing its work she can barely see let alone find me in the darkness
even so she keeps on walking the silver pistol glinting in her right hand and the starting pistol in her left
its pressed against her leg out of sight
she has courage ill give her that
reaching the edge of the reflecting pool evelyn hesitates and knowing what comes next i wonder if perhaps the silver pistol is too heavy for her now the weight of the plan too much
god help us she says quietly turning the gun towards her stomach and pulling the trigger of the starting pistol by her leg
the shot is so loud it cracks the world the starting pistol slipping from evelyns hand into the inky blackness of the reflecting pool as the silver pistol hits the grass
blood spreads across her dress
she watches it bemused then topples forward into the pool
anguish paralyses me some combination of the gunshot and evelyns expression before she fell nudging an old memory loose
you dont have time for this
its so close
i can almost see another face hear another plea
another woman i failed to save who i came to blackheath to what
why did i come here i gasp out loud struggling to pull the memory up from the darkness
save evelyn shes drowning
blinking i look at the reflecting pool where evelyns floating face down
panic washes away the pain and i scramble to my feet leaping through the bushes and into the icy water
her dress has spread across the surface as heavy as a sodden sack and the base of the reflecting pool is covered in slippery moss
i cant get any purchase on her
theres a commotion by the ballroom
derby is fighting with michael hardcastle drawing almost as much attention as the dying woman in the pool
fireworks explode overhead staining everything in red and purple yellow and orange light
i hook my arms around evelyns midriff wrestling her out of the water and onto the grass
slumped in the mud i catch my breath checking to make sure cunninghams taken firm hold of michael as i asked him to
he has
the plans working
no thanks to me
the old memory the gunshot stirred almost paralysed me
another woman and another death
it was the fear on evelyns face
thats what did it
i recognised that fear
its what brought me to blackheath im certain of it
doctor dickie runs up to me
hes flushed panting a fortune going up in flames behind his eyes
evelyn told me hed been paid to fake the death certificate
the jovial old soldiers got quite the criminal empire up and running
what happened he says
she shot herself i respond watching the hope blossom on his face
i saw the entire thing but i couldnt do anything  you mustnt blame yourself he clasps me by the shoulder
listen here why dont you go and get a brandy while i look her over
leave it to me eh  as he kneels beside the body i scoop the silver pistol off the ground and make my way to michael whos still being held fast by cunningham
looking at the two of them i wouldnt have thought it possible
michaels short and stocky a bull ensnared by cunninghams ropelike arms
even so michaels writhing is only tightening cunninghams grip
a pry bar and a chisel couldnt free him at this point
im terribly sorry mr hardcastle i say placing a sympathetic hand on the struggling mans arm
your sister took her own life  the fight goes out of him immediately tears building in his eyes as his anguished gaze goes out towards the pool
you cant know that he says straining to see past me
she might still be  the doctor has confirmed it im so sorry i say taking the silver pistol from my pocket and pressing it into his palm
she used this gun do you recognise it  no  well you should keep hold of it for the moment i suggest
ive asked a couple of footmen to carry her body into the sun room away from – i gesture towards the gathered crowds – well everybody
if youd like a few minutes alone with your sister i can arrange it  hes staring at the pistol dumbly as though hes been delivered some object from the far future
mr hardcastle  shaking his head his empty eyes find me
what yes of course he says his fingers closing around the gun
thank you inspector  just a constable sir i say waving cunningham over
charles would you mind escorting mr hardcastle to the sun room
keep him away from the crowds would you  cunningham meets my request with a curt nod placing a hand on michaels lower back and gently guiding him towards the house
not for the first time im glad the valet is on my side
watching him depart i feel a pang of sadness that this will probably be the last time we meet
for all the mistrust and lies ive grown fond of him this last week
dickies finished his examination the old man getting slowly to his feet
under his watchful eye the footmen drag evelyns body onto a stretcher
he wears his sadness like a secondhand suit
i dont know how i didnt see it before
this is murder as pantomime and everywhere i look the curtain is rustling
as evelyn is lifted off the ground i race through the rain towards the sun room on the far side of the house slipping inside through the french doors i unlocked earlier and concealing myself behind an oriental screen
evelyns grandmother watches me from the painting above the fireplace
in the flickering candlelight i could swear shes smiling
perhaps she knows what i know
maybe shes always known and has been forced to watch day after day as the rest of us blundered through here oblivious to the truth
no wonder she was scowling before
rain raps the windows as the footmen arrive with their stretcher
they move slowly trying not to jostle the body which is now draped in dickies jacket
in no time at all theyre inside transferring the body onto the sideboard pressing their flat caps to their chests in respect before departing closing the french doors behind them
i watch them go catching sight of myself in the glass my hands stuffed into my pockets rashtons quietly competent face suggesting nothing but certainty
even my reflection is lying to me
certainty was the first thing blackheath took from me
the door swings open the draught from the corridor swiping at the candle flames
in the gaps between the screens panels i can see michael pale and shaking gripping the doorframe for support tears in his eyes
cunninghams behind him and after flashing a covert glance towards the screen where im hiding he closes the door on us
the instant hes alone michael springs out of his grief his shoulders straightening and eyes hardening his sorrow transformed into something altogether more feral
hurrying over to evelyns body he searches her bloodied stomach for a bullet hole murmuring to himself when he doesnt find one
frowning he removes the magazine from the gun i gave him outside finding it loaded
evelyn was supposed to take a black revolver to the pool not this silver pistol
he must be wondering what caused her to change the plan and whether shes actually carried through on the plot
satisfied shes still alive he backs away fingers drumming his lips as he weighs the pistol
he appears to be in communion with it frowning and biting his lip as though navigating a series of tricky questions
i lose sight of him momentarily when he strides off into the corner of the room forcing me to lean out a little from my hiding place to get a better look
hes picked up an embroidered pillow from one of the chairs and he brings it to evelyn pressing it against her stomach presumably to muffle the sound of the pistol jammed up against it
there isnt even a pause any sort of goodbye
turning his face away he pulls the trigger
the pistol clicks impotently
he tries again and again until i step out from behind the screen putting an end to this charade
it wont work i say
i filed down the firing pin  he doesnt turn around
he doesnt even let go of the pistol
ill make you a rich man if you let me kill her inspector he says a quiver in his voice
i cant do that and as i told you outside im a constable  oh not for very much longer with a mind like yours im sure  hes trembling the pistol still held firm against evelyns body
sweat is trickling down my spine the tension in the room thick enough to scoop up in handfuls
drop the weapon and turn around mr hardcastle
slowly if you please  you dont need to fear me inspector he says dropping the pistol into a plant pot and turning around with his hands in the air
i have no desire to hurt anybody  no desire i say surprised by the sorrow on his face
you tried to put five bullets into your own sister  and every one of them would have been a kindness i assure you  hands still raised he angles a long finger towards an armchair near the chessboard where i first met evelyn
mind if i sit down he asks
im feeling a little lightheaded  be my guest i say watching him closely as he drops into the chair
part of me worries hes going to make a dash for the door but truth be told he looks like a man whos had all the fight wrung out of him
hes pale and twitchy arms hanging limp by his sides legs splayed out before him
if i had to guess id say it took all his strength to decide to pull the trigger
murder didnt come easy to this man
i let him settle then drag a wingback chair over from the window to sit opposite him
how did you know what i was planning to do he asks
it was the revolvers i say sinking a little deeper into the cushion
the revolvers  two matching black revolvers were taken from your mothers room early this morning
evelyn had one and you the other
i couldnt understand why  im not following  the only obvious reasons evelyn had to steal a gun were because she thought herself in danger – a rather redundant explanation for somebody about to commit suicide – or because she planned to use it in the suicide
the latter being more likely what reason could she possibly have for taking both of the revolvers
surely one was up to the task  and where did these thoughts lead you  nowhere until dance noticed you carrying the second revolver on the hunt
what had been odd was now damn peculiar
a woman contemplating suicide at her lowest ebb has enough forethought to remember her brothers aversion to hunting and steal the second weapon for him  my sister loves me a great deal inspector  perhaps but you told dance that you didnt know you were going hunting until midday and the revolvers disappeared from your mothers room early in the morning well before that decision was made
evelyn couldnt possibly have taken the second gun for the reason you suggested
once i heard about your sisters fake suicide scheme i realised you were lying and from there everything became clear
evelyn didnt take the revolvers from your mothers room
you did
you kept one and gave evelyn the other to use as a prop  evelyn told you about the fake suicide he asks his tone dubious
partially i say
she explained how youd agreed to help her by running up to the reflecting pool and dragging her onto the grass as a grieving brother naturally would
thats when i saw how you could commit the perfect crime and why you needed two matching revolvers
before pulling her out of the pool all you had to do was shoot her in the stomach using the fireworks as cover for the second shot
the murder weapon would disappear into the murky water and the bullet would match the identical gun shed just dropped on the grass
murder by suicide
it was quite brilliant really  which is why you made her use the silver pistol instead he says understanding coming into his voice
you needed me to change my plan  i had to bait the trap  very clever he says miming applause
not clever enough i say surprised by his calmness
i still dont understand how you could go through with it
time and again today ive been told how close you and evelyn are
how much you care for her
was that all a lie  anger brings him upright in his chair
i love my sister more than anything in this world he says glaring at me
i would do anything for her
why else do you think she came to me for help
why else would i have said yes  his passion has thrown me
i set this plan in motion believing i knew the story michael would be telling but this isnt it
i expected to hear how his mother had put him on this path while she orchestrated events elsewhere
not for the first time i have the unmistakable feeling of having misread the map
if you love your sister why betray her i ask confused
because her plan wasnt going to work he says slapping his palm down on the arm of the chair
we couldnt pay the amount dickie wanted for the fake death certificate
he agreed to assist us anyway but yesterday coleridge found out that dickie was planning to sell our secret to father later this evening
do you see
after all this evelyn would have woken up in blackheath trapped in the same life she was so desperate to escape  did you tell her this  how could i he asks miserably
this plan was her one chance to be free to be happy
how could i take that away from her  you could have killed dickie  coleridge said the same thing but when
i needed him to confirm evelyns death and he intended on meeting my father directly afterwards he shakes his head
i made the only decision i could  there are two glasses of scotch beside his chair one halfway full and smeared with lipstick the other unmarked a little alcohol left at the bottom
he reaches towards the lipsticksmeared one slowly keeping his eyes on me
mind if i have a drink he asks
its evelyns
we had a toast in here before the ball began
best of luck and all that  theres a catch in his throat
any other host might think him repentant but rashton can spot fear a mile away
of course  he picks it up gratefully and takes a stiff slug
if nothing else it serves to steady his trembling hands
i know my sister inspector he says his voice hoarse
shes always hated being forced into things even when we were children
she couldnt bear the humiliation of a life with ravencourt knowing people were laughing behind her back
look at what she was willing to do to avoid it
slowly but surely that marriage would have destroyed her
i wanted to spare her that suffering  his cheeks are flushed his green eyes glazed
theyre filled with such a sweet sincere sorrow that i almost believe him
and i suppose the money had nothing to do with it i say flatly
a scowl mars his sadness
evelyn told me that your parents threatened to cut you from the will if she didnt do as they asked i say
you were leverage and it worked
that threat was the reason she obeyed their summons in the first place but who knows if shed have done the same thing again knowing her escape plan was gone
with evelyn dead that uncertainty is laid to rest  look around you inspector he says gesturing around the room with his glass
do you really think any of this is worth killing for  now your father cant squander the family fortune i imagine your prospects have improved immeasurably  squandering the fortune is all my fathers good for he snorts finishing his drink
is that why you killed him  his scowl deepens
hes tightlipped pale
i found his body michael
i know you poisoned him probably when you went to fetch him for the hunt
you left a note blaming evelyn
the boot print outside the window was particularly devious his expression flickers uncertainly
or was that somebody else i say slowly
felicity perhaps
ill admit i still havent untangled that knot
or was it your mothers
where is she michael
or did you kill her as well  his eyes widen as his face crumples in shock his glass slipping from his hand onto the floor
you deny it i ask suddenly uncertain
no
i
i  wheres your mother michael
did she put you up to this  she
i  at first i mistake his floundering for remorse his gasping for the shallow breaths of a man searching for the right words
its only when his fingers grip the arm of the chair white foam running down his lips that i realise hes been poisoned
i spring to my feet in alarm but i have no idea what to do
somebody help us i yell
his back arches his muscles tense his eyes turning red as the blood vessels pop
gurgling he falls forward onto the floor
from behind me i hear rattling
swinging around i find evelyn convulsing on the sideboard the same white foam bubbling up between her lips
the door bursts open cunningham taking in the scene with an open mouth
whats happening he asks
theyve been poisoned i say looking from one to the other
fetch dickie  hes gone before the words have fallen from my lips
hand to my forehead i stare helplessly at them
evelyn is writhing on the sideboard as if possessed while michaels clenched teeth crack in his mouth
the drugs you fool
my hand dives into my pocket retrieving the three vials i was instructed to steal from bells trunk when cunningham and i ransacked it this afternoon
unwrapping the note i search for instructions i know arent on it
presumably i mix everything together but i dont know how much to give them
i dont even know if i have enough for two doses
i dont know who to save i cry looking from michael to evelyn
michael knows more than hes told us
but i gave evelyn my word id protect her i say
evelyn spasms on the table so violently she falls to the floor as michael continues to thrash his eyes now rolled so far back in his head only the whites can be seen
damn it i say running over to the bar
emptying the three vials into a scotch glass i add water from a jug and stir it all together until it foams
evelyns back is arched her fingers biting into the thick weave of a rug
tilting her head back i pour the entire filthy creation down her throat even as michael chokes behind me
evelyns seizures end as abruptly as they started
blood weeping from her eyes she sucks in deep hoarse breaths
letting out a sigh of relief i touch my fingers to her neck checking for a pulse
its frantic but its strong
shes going to live
unlike michael
i cast a guilty glance at the body of the young man
he looks exactly as his father did in the sitting room
theyve clearly been poisoned by the same hand using the strychnine sebastian bell smuggled into the house
it must have been in the scotch he drank
evelyns scotch
her glass was half full
judging by how long it took to affect her she can only have taken a sip or two
michael by contrast finished the lot in under a minute
did he know it was poisoned
the alarm i saw on his face suggests not
this was somebody elses work
theres another killer in blackheath
but who i demand angry with myself for allowing this to happen
felicity
helena hardcastle
who was michael working with
or was it somebody he knew nothing about  evelyns stirring the colour already returning to her cheeks
whatever was in that concoction its working fast though shes still weak
her fingers paw at my sleeve her lips forming empty sounds
i lower my ear to her mouth
im not – she swallows – millicent was murder  very weakly she tugs at her throat pulling out the chain which was concealed by her dress
theres a signet ring on the end of it bearing the hardcastle family seal if im not very much mistaken
i blink at her not understanding
i hope you got everything you needed says a voice from the french doors
its not going to do you much good though  looking over my shoulder i see the footman emerging out of the darkness his knife glinting in the candlelight as he taps the point against his thigh
hes wearing his red and white livery the jacket dotted with grease spots and dirt as though the essence of him is somehow leaking through
a clean empty hunting sack is tied to his waist and with mounting horror i remember how he tossed a full sack at derbys feet the material so blood soaked it hit the ground with a wet slap
i check the clock
derby will be out there now sitting in the warmth of a brazier watching the party dissolve around him
whatever the footmans going to put in the bag he plans to carve off rashton
the footman smiles at me his eyes glittering in anticipation
youd think id get bored of killing you wouldnt you he asks
the silver pistols still in the plant pot where michael discarded it
it wont fire but the footman doesnt know that
if i could reach it i might be able to bluff him into fleeing
it will be a closerun thing but theres a table in his way
i should be able to get there before him
im going to do it slow he says touching his broken nose
i owe you for this  fear doesnt come easily to rashton but hes afraid now and so am i i have two hosts left after today but gregory gold is going to spend most of his day strung up in the gatehouse and donald davies is stranded on a dirt road miles from here
if i die now theres no telling how many more chances ill get to escape blackheath
dont worry about the gun says the footman
you wont need it  mistaking his meaning hope flares in my chest fizzling again when i see his smirk
oh no my handsome lad im going to kill you he says wagging the knife at me
i just mean you aint going to fight me he adds coming closer
see ive got anna and if you dont want her to die messy youre going to give yourself to me and then youre going to bring whoevers left to the graveyard tonight  opening his palm he reveals annas chess piece spotted with blood
with a flick of his wrist he tosses it into the fire the flames consuming it immediately
another step closer
whats it to be he asks
my hands are clenched by my sides my mouth dry
for as long as he can remember rashton expected to die young
in a dark alley or on a battlefield a place beyond light and comfort beyond friendship his situation hopeless
he knew how sharp the edges of his life had become and hed made peace with it because he knew hed die fighting
futile as it may have been weak as it may have been he expected to wade into the darkness with his fists in the air
and now the footman has taken even that away
im to die without a struggle and i feel ashamed
whats the answer says the footman his impatience growing
i cant bring myself to say the words to admit how thoroughly defeated i am
another hour in this body and id have solved it and that knowledge makes me want to scream
your answer he demands
i manage to nod as he looms over me his stench wrapping itself around me when he sinks the blade into the familiar spot beneath my ribs blood filling my throat and mouth
gripping my chin he lifts my face looking me in the eyes
two to go he says and with that he twists the blade
52   day three continued  rain thumps the roof horses clipclopping along the cobbles
i am in a carriage two women in evening wear wedged onto the seat opposite me
theyre talking under their breath their shoulders bumping together as the carriage sways from side to side
dont get out of the carriage
fear prickles my spine
this is the moment gold warned me about
the moment which drove him mad
out there in the dark the footmans waiting with his knife
hes awake audrey says one of them noticing me stirring
perhaps believing my hearing to be defective the second lady leans close
we found you asleep near the road she says loudly laying one hand on my knee
your automobile was a few miles further up the driver tried to get it running but it was beyond him  im donald davies i say feeling a surge of relief
the last time i was this man i drove a car through the night until morning dawned abandoning it when the fuel ran out
i walked for hours along that neverending road towards the village collapsing in exhaustion no nearer my destination
he must have slept the entire day away saving him from the footmans wrath
the plague doctor told me id be returned to davies when he woke up again
i never could have imagined hed have been rescued and returned to blackheath when it happened
finally some good luck
you sweet beautiful woman i say cupping my saviours cheeks and kissing her soundly on the lips
you dont know what youve done  before she can respond i poke my head out of the window
its evening the carriages swaying lanterns gently illuminating the darkness rather than banishing it
were in one of three carriages rolling towards the house from the village twelve or so others parked either side of the road their drivers snoring or chatting in small groups passing a solitary cigarette amongst themselves
i can hear music from the direction of the house shrill laughter climbing high enough to puncture the distance between us
the party is in full swing
hope surges through me
evelyn hasnt made her way to the reflecting pool which means there may still be time for me to question michael and discover if he was working with anybody
even if im too late for that i can still ambush the footman when he comes for rashton and find out where hes keeping anna
dont get out of the carriage
blackheath in a few minutes mlady the driver shouts down from somewhere above us
i glance out of the window again
the house is directly in front of us and the stables down the road on our right
thats where they keep the shotguns and id have to be a fool to tackle the footman without one
unlocking the door i leap from the carriage landing in a painful heap on the wet cobbles
the ladies are shrieking the coach driver yelling after me as i pick myself up and stagger towards the distant lights
the plague doctor told me the pattern of this day was dictated by the character of those living it
i can only hope thats true and fate is in a charitable mood because if its not ive damned both myself and anna
within the glow of the braziers stable boys are undoing the harnesses connecting the horses and carriages leading the whinnying beasts to shelter
theyre working quickly but they look done in barely able to speak
i approach the nearest chap who despite the rain is wearing only a cotton shirt with the sleeves rolled up
where do you keep the shotguns i ask
hes tightening a harness gritting his teeth as he pulls the taut strap towards the last buckle
he peers at me suspiciously his eyes narrowed beneath his flat cap
bit late for hunting aint it he says
and far too early for impertinence i snap overwhelmed by my hosts upperclass disdain
where are the damn shotguns or do i need to bring lord hardcastle down here to ask you himself  after looking me up and down he gestures over his shoulder towards a small redbrick building a dim light seeping through the window
the shotguns are arranged on a wooden rack boxes of shells stored in a nearby drawer
i take one down and load it carefully dropping a handful of spare shells into my pocket
the gun is heavy a cold slab of courage that propels me across the yard and up the road towards blackheath
the stable hands exchange looks as i approach standing aside to let me pass
doubtless they think me some rich lunatic with a score to settle a piece of gossip to add to the pile tomorrow morning
certainly not somebody worth risking bodily harm for
im glad of that
if they were to creep closer they might notice how crowded my eyes are how all my previous hosts are jostling for a better view
in some way or another the footmans harmed every one of them and theyve all turned up for his execution
i can barely think through their clamour
halfway along the road i notice a light bobbing towards me and my grip tightens around the shotguns trigger
its me yells daniel over the din of the storm
theres a storm lantern in his hand the waxy light running down his face and upper body
he looks like a genie spilled out of a bottle
we have to hurry the footmans in the graveyard says daniel
he has anna with him  he still thinks were fooled by his act
my finger strokes the shotgun as i stare back towards blackheath trying to decide the best course of action
michael could be in the sun room as we speak but im certain daniel knows where annas being kept and i wont have a better opportunity to get the information from him
two roads and two ends and somehow i know one of them leads to failure
this is our chance yells daniel wiping the rain from his eyes
this is what weve been waiting for
hes in there right now lying in wait
he doesnt know weve found each other
we can spring his trap we can finish this together  for so long i fought to change my future to alter the day
now i have im undone racked with the futility of my choices
i saved evelyn and thwarted michael two things which only matter if anna and i live long enough to tell the plague doctor at 11 pm past this point im making every decision blind and with only one host left after today every decision matters
what if we fail i shout back my words barely making it to his ears
the clatter of rain on stone is almost deafening the wind ripping and tearing at the forest screaming through the trees like some feral creature slipped loose of its cage
what choice do we have daniel yells clutching the back of my neck
we have a plan which means for the first time we have the advantage over him
we must pursue it  i remember the first time i met this man how calm he seemed how patient and reasonable
none of that is in him now
its all been washed away in blackheaths endless storms
he has the eyes of a fanatic eager and imploring wild and desperate
he has as much riding on the outcome of this moment as i do
hes right
we need to put an end to this
what time is it i ask
he frowns
why does that matter  i never know until afterwards i say
the time
please  he checks his watch impatiently
its 946 he says
can we go now  nodding i follow him across the lawn
the stars are cowards closing their eyes as we creep closer to the graveyard and by the time daniel pushes open the gate our only lights the flickering glow of his storm lantern
were shielded by the trees back here muting the storm which makes its way through to us in sharp gusts daggers of wind slipping through the cracks in the armour of the forest
we should hide out of sight whispers daniel hanging the lantern on the angels arm
well call to anna when she arrives  lifting the shotgun to my shoulder i press both barrels to the back of his head
you can drop the act daniel i know were not the same man i say my eyes flicking across the woods searching for some sign of the footman
unfortunately the lanterns so bright it obscures much of what it should reveal
hands in the air turn around i say
he does as i ask staring at me pulling me apart looking for something broken
i dont know whether he finds it or not but after a long silence a charming smile breaks out on his handsome face
couldnt last forever i suppose he says gesturing to his breast pocket
i motion for him to continue and he slowly withdraws a cigarette case tapping one out against his palm
i followed this man into the graveyard knowing that if i didnt confront him id always be looking over my shoulder waiting for him to strike again but now im here faced with his calmness my certainty is wavering
where is she daniel
wheres anna i say
why that was to be my question to you he says placing the cigarette between his lips
that was it exactly where is anna
ive been trying to get you to tell me all day even thought id succeeded when derby agreed to help me flush the footman out from under the house
you should have seen your face so eager to please  shielding his cigarette from the wind he lights it at the third try illuminating a face thats as holloweyed as those of the statues beside him
i have a gun pointed at him and somehow he still has the upper hand
wheres the footman i say the shotgun growing heavy in my arms
i know youre partners  oh its nothing like that
im afraid youve got the wrong end of the stick entirely he says dismissing the fellow with a wave of his hand
hes not like you me or anna
hes one of coleridges associates
theres actually a few of them in the house
unsavoury chaps the lot of them but then coleridge is in an unsavoury business
the footman as you call him was the brightest of them so i explained what was happening in blackheath
i dont think he believed me but killings rather his speciality so he didnt bat an eyelid when i pointed him at your hosts
probably enjoyed it truth be told
helps enormously that ive made him a very rich man of course  blowing smoke out through his nostrils he grins as though weve shared some private joke
hes moving with assurance the confidence of a man living in a world of premonitions
a dispiriting contrast to my shaking hands and thudding heart
hes got something planned and until i know what it is i cant do anything but wait
youre like anna arent you i say
one day and then you forget everything and start again  hardly seems fair does it
not when you have eight lives and eight days
all the gifts were given to you
now why was that  i see the plague doctor didnt tell you everything about me  he grins again
its like ice rolling down my spine
why are you doing this daniel i ask surprised by my misery
we could have helped each other  but my dear fellow you have helped me he says
i have both of stanwins blackmail books in my possession
without derby poking around his bedroom i might only have found the one and id be no nearer an answer than i was this morning
in two hours ill take what ive learned to the lake and be free of this place and its your doing
surely you can take some comfort in that  wet steps sound
a shotgun is cocked cold metal presses into my back
a thug brushes past me taking a spot in the light beside daniel
unlike his friend behind me he isnt armed though he doesnt need to be by the looks of things
he has the face of barroom brawler his nose broken his cheek decorated by an ugly scar
hes rubbing his knuckles his tongue roaming his lips in anticipation
neither action makes me feel terribly confident about whats coming
be a dear and drop the weapon says daniel
sighing i let the shotgun fall on the floor raising my hands in the air
foolish as it may be my overriding thought is to wish they werent trembling so
you can come out now says daniel in a louder voice
theres a rustling in the bushes to my left the plague doctor stepping into the pool of light cast by the lantern
im about to hurl some insult at him when i notice a single silver tear painted on the left side of his mask
its glittering in the light and now i take stock i realise there are other differences
this coat is finer darker the edges not so frayed
embroidered roses twist up the gloves and now i see this person is shorter more erect in their posture
this isnt the plague doctor at all
you were the one talking to daniel by the lake i say
daniel whistles flicking a glance at his companion
how on earth did he see that he asks silver tear
didnt you pick that spot so nobody would find us together  i saw you outside the gatehouse as well i say
curiouser and curiouser says daniel enjoying himself immensely at his confederates expense
i thought you knew every second of his day he adopts a pompous tone
nothing happens here that is beyond my sight mr coleridge he huffs
if that were true i wouldnt need your help capturing annabelle says silver tear
her voice is stately a far cry from the putupon plague doctor
mr bishops actions have disrupted the usual course of events
hes changed evelyn hardcastles fate and contributed to the death of her brother unpicking the threads that hold this day together in the process
hes maintained his alliance with annabelle far longer than he ever has before which means things are happening out of order running long or short if they happen at all
nothings quite where it should be  the mask turns towards me
you should be commended mr bishop she says
i havent seen blackheath in this much disarray for decades  who are you i say
i could ask the same of you she says waving my question away
i wont because you dont know yourself and there are more pressing questions
suffice to say ive been sent by my superiors to rectify my colleagues mistake
now please tell mr coleridge where he might find annabelle  annabelle  he calls her anna says daniel
what do you want with anna i ask
thats not your concern says silver tear
its getting to be i say
you must want her very badly if youre willing to make a deal with somebody like daniel to bring her to you  im redressing the balance she says
do you think its a coincidence that you inhabit the hosts you do the men closest to evelyns murder
are you not curious why you woke up in donald davies precisely when you needed him most
my colleague has been playing favourites from the beginning and that is forbidden
he was supposed to watch without interfering to appear at the lake and wait for an answer
nothing more
worse hes opened the door to a creature who must never be allowed to leave this house
i cannot let this continue  so thats why youre here says the plague doctor emerging from the shadows rainwater running in rivulets down his mask
daniel tenses watching the interloper warily
apologies for not announcing myself earlier josephine continues the plague doctor his attention fixed on silver tear
i wasnt certain youd tell me the truth if i asked directly given how hard youve worked to stay hidden
i would never have known you were in blackheath if mr rashton hadnt spotted you  josephine interrupts daniel
you two are acquainted  silver tear ignores him
i hoped it wouldnt come to this she says addressing the plague doctor
her tone has softened warmed
it ripples with regret
my intention was to complete my task and depart without you knowing  i fail to see why youre here at all
blackheath is my watch and everything is well in hand  you cant believe that she says becoming exasperated
look at how close aiden and annabelle have become how near they are to escape
hes willing to sacrifice himself for her
do you see that
if we let this continue before long shell be standing before you with an answer and then what will you do  im confident it wont come to that  im confident it will she snorts
tell me truthfully will you let her leave  the question knocks him silent a moment a slight tilt of his head conveying his indecision
my eyes slip towards daniel whos watching them his face rapt
i imagine he feels as i do like a child watching his parents argue understanding only half of the things being said
when the plague doctor speaks again his voice is firm though rehearsed his conviction born of repetition rather than faith
the rules of blackheath are very clear and im beholden to them as are you he says
if she brings me the name of evelyn hardcastles murderer i cant refuse to hear her case  rules or not you know what our superiors will do to you if annabelle escapes blackheath  have they sent you to replace me  of course they havent she sighs sounding hurt
do you think their reaction would be so temperate
i came as your friend to clean up this mess before they ever find out how close you came to blundering
im quietly going to remove annabelle ensuring you wont have to make a choice youll regret  she signals to daniel
mr coleridge could you please persuade mr bishop to reveal annabelles location
i trust you understand whats at stake  crushing his cigarette underfoot daniel nods at the brawler who takes hold of my arms pinning me in place
i try to struggle but hes much too strong
this is forbidden josephine says the plague doctor shocked
we do not take direct action
we do not give orders
we certainly dont feed them information they arent supposed to know
youre breaking every rule weve promised to uphold  you dare lecture me says silver tear scornfully
all youve done is interfere  the plague doctor shakes his head vehemently
i explained mr bishops purpose here and encouraged him when he faltered
unlike daniel and anna he didnt wake up with the rules burned into him
he was free to doubt to veer from his purpose
i never gave him knowledge he hadnt earned as you have done with daniel
i sought to bring balance not offer advantage
im begging you dont do this
let events follow their natural course
hes so close to solving it  and because of that so is annabelle she says her voice hardening
im sorry i must choose between aiden bishops wellbeing and your own
proceed mr coleridge  no yells the plague doctor holding out a placating hand
the thug with the shotgun points it at him
hes nervous his finger gripping the trigger a little too tightly
i dont know if the plague doctor can be hurt by these weapons but i cant let him risk it
i need him alive
just leave i say to him
theres nothing else you can do here  this is wrong he protests
then make it right
my other hosts need you i pause meaningfully
i dont  i dont know if its my intonation or whether hes simply watched this moment play out before but finally grudgingly he relents staring at josephine before disappearing out of the graveyard
selfless as always says daniel walking towards me
i want you to know that ive admired that quality aiden
the way youve fought to save the woman whose death would set you free
your fondness for anna who would have undoubtedly betrayed you if i hadnt done so first
in the end though im afraid its all been for nothing
only one of us can leave this house and i have no interest in it being you  crows are gathering in the branches above me
they arrive as if by invitation gliding in on silent wings their feathers slick with recent rain
there are dozens of them pressed together like mourners at a funeral watching me with a curiosity that makes my skin crawl
up until an hour ago we had anna in our custody
somehow shes managed to escape continues daniel
where would she go aiden
tell me where shes hiding and ill instruct my men to make your death quick
theres only you and gold left now
two gunshots and youll wake up in bell knock on blackheaths door and start everything again without my getting in your way
youre a clever fellow im certain youll solve evelyns murder in no time  his face is ghoulish in the lantern light twisted by need
how frightened are you daniel i say slowly
youve killed my future hosts so im not a threat but you have no idea where anna is
its been eating away at you all day hasnt it
the fear that shes going to solve this before you  its my smile that scares him the faintest sense that i might not be quite so trapped as he first believed
if you dont give me what i want ill start cutting says daniel drawing a line across my cheek with his fingertip
ill take you apart an inch at a time  i know ive met myself after youre done i say staring at him
you break my mind so badly i carry my madness into gregory gold
he slashes his own arms and babbles warnings at edward dance
its horrific
and my answer is still no  tell me where she is he says raising his voice
coleridge has half the servants in this house on his payroll and i have a pocketbook thick enough to buy the other half if necessary
i can surround the lake twice over
dont you see
ive already won
whats the use of being stubborn now  practice i snarl
im not going to tell you anything daniel
every minute i frustrate you is another minute anna has to reach the plague doctor with the answer
youd need a hundred men to guard that lake on a pitchblack night like this and i doubt even silver tear can help with that  youll suffer he hisses
one hour until 11 pm i say
which one of us do you think can hold out the longer  daniel hits me hard enough to rip the air from my lungs and knock me to my knees
when i look up hes looming over me rubbing his grazed knuckles
anger flickers at the edges of his face like a storm creeping across a cloudless sky
gone is the suave gambler of earlier replaced by a scrappy conman his body twisted by redhot anger
im going to kill you slowly he growls
im not the one who dies here daniel i say letting loose a shrill whistle
birds scatter from the trees the underbrush rustling with movement
in the inky blackness of the forest a lantern flares into life
its followed by another a few feet away and then another
daniel spins on the spot following the lanterns
he hasnt noticed silver tear whos backing into the forest looking unsure of herself
youve hurt a lot of people i say as the lights come closer
and now you get to face them  how he stammers confounded by the reversal in his fortunes
i killed all your future hosts  you didnt kill their friends i say
when anna told me her plan to lure the footman here i decided wed need more bodies and i asked cunningham to help
once i realised you and the footman were in league together i expanded my recruiting drive
it wasnt hard to find enemies of yours  grace davies appears first shotgun raised
rashton nearly bit his tongue off to prevent me from asking for her help but i was short of options
the rest of my hosts are busy or dead and cunningham is at the ball with ravencourt
the second light belongs to lucy harper who was easily swayed to my cause by the revelation that daniel murdered her father and finally comes stanwins bodyguard his head completely bandaged aside from those cold hard eyes
though theyre all armed none of them looks very confident and i wouldnt trust a single one to hit anything theyre aiming at
it doesnt matter
at this stage its the numbers that count and theyre enough to rattle daniel and silver tear whose mask is sweeping back and forth searching for an escape
its over daniel i say my voice steely
surrender and ill let you go back to blackheath unharmed  he glares at me desperately then at my friends
i know what this place can do to us i continue
but you were kind to bell that first morning and i saw your affection for michael on the hunt
be a good man one more time and call off the footman
let me and anna go with your blessing  his expression wavers torment showing on his face but its not enough
blackheath has poisoned him completely
kill them he says savagely
a shotgun explodes behind me and i instinctively throw myself to the ground
my allies scatter as daniels man advances on them firing shot after shot into the darkness
the unarmed man is cutting left keeping low as he tries to take them by surprise
i cant tell whether its my anger or my hosts which drives me to lash out at daniel
donald davies is raging although his fury is one of class rather than crime
hes aggrieved that anybody should presume to treat him so shabbily
my anger is altogether more personal
daniel has blocked my way ever since that first morning
he sought to escape blackheath by climbing out over me undoing my plans in service of his own
he came to me as a friend smiling as he lied laughing as he betrayed me and its this that causes me to hurl myself like a spear at his midriff
he slips aside catching me in the stomach with an uppercut
doubled over i punch him in the groin and then grab his neck dragging him to the ground
i see the compass too late
he smashes it into my cheek the glass splintering blood dripping off my chin
my eyes are watering sodden leaves squelching beneath my palms
daniel advances but a shot whistles past him catching silver tear who screams clutching her shoulder and falling in a heap
glancing at the trembling gun in lucy harpers hand daniel sprints off towards blackheath
picking myself up i give chase
we run like a hound and fox across the lawn in front of the house and down the driveway towards the village flying past the gatehouse
im almost convinced hes fleeing to the village when finally he turns left following the trail to the well and beyond that the lake
its pitchblack the moon prowling the clouds like a dog behind an old wooden fence and i soon lose sight of my quarry
fearing an ambush i slow my pursuit listening intently
owls hoot rain drips through the leaves of the trees
branches snatch at me as i duck and weave emerging upon daniel doubled over by the edge of the water with his hands on his knees panting for breath a storm lantern at his feet
theres nowhere left for him to run
my hands are shaking fear squirming in my chest
anger gave me courage but its also made a fool of me
donald davies is short and slight softer than the beds he lies in
daniel is taller stronger
he preys on these people
whatever numerical advantage i had in the graveyard ive left far behind which means that for the first time since i arrived in blackheath neither of us knows whats coming next
spotting my approach daniel waves me back gesturing for a minute to catch his breath
i give it to him using the time to select a heavy rock i can use as a weapon
after the compass were beyond fighting fair
whatever you do theyre not going to let your friend leave he says forcing out the words between breaths
silver tear told me everything about you in exchange for a promise that id find and kill anna
she told me about your hosts where they woke up and when
dont you understand
none of this matters aiden
im the only one who can escape  you could have told me this earlier i say
it didnt have to end like this  i have a wife and a son he says
thats the memory i brought with me
can you imagine how that feels
knowing theyre out there waiting for me
or they were  i take a step towards him the rock by my side
how will you face them knowing what you did to escape this place i ask
im only what blackheath has made me he pants spitting phlegm into the mud
no blackheaths what we made it i say advancing a little more
hes still buckled still tired
a couple more steps and this will all be over
our decisions led us here daniel
if this is hell then its one of our making  and what would you have us do he says looking up at me
sit here and repent until somebody sees fit to open the doors  help me save evelyn and we can take what we know to the plague doctor together i say passionately
all three of us you me and anna
we have a chance to walk out of this place better men than we arrived  i cant risk it he says in a flat dead voice
i wont let this opportunity to escape pass me by
not for guilt and not to help people long past helping  without warning he kicks the storm lantern over
night floods my eyes
i hear the splash of his steps before his shoulder drives into my stomach knocking the wind from me
we hit the ground with a thud the rock dropping from my hands
its all i can do to throw my arms up to protect myself but theyre thin and frail and his punches easily break through
blood fills my mouth
im numb inside and out but the blows keep coming until his knuckles slip off my bloody cheeks
his weight recedes as he lifts himself free of me
hes panting his sweat dripping onto me
i tried to avoid this he says
strong fingers grip my ankle dragging me through the mud towards the water
i reach for him but his assault has driven the strength from me and i collapse back
he pauses wiping the sweat from his brow
moonlight hammers through the clouds bleaching his features
his hair is silver his skin white as fresh snow
hes looking down at me with the same pity he showed bell the first morning i arrived
we dont i say coughing up blood
you should have stayed out of my way he says yanking me forward once again
thats all i ever asked of you  he splashes into the lake pulling me with him the cold water rushing up my legs soaking my chest and head
the shock of it stirs some fight within me and i try to claw my way back up the bank but daniel grabs my hair pushing my face into the freezing water
i scratch at his hand kicking my legs but hes too strong
my body convulses desperate for a breath
still he holds me down
i see thomas hardcastle dead these last nineteen years swimming towards me out of the murk
hes blondhaired and wideeyed lost down here but he takes my hand and squeezes my fingers urging me to be brave
unable to hold my breath any longer my mouth springs open gulping in cold muddy water
my body spasms
thomas pulls my spirit clear of this dying flesh and we float side by side in the water watching donald davies drown
its peaceful and still
surprisingly quiet
then something crashes into the water
hands plunge through the surface gripping the body of donald davies tearing him upwards and a second later i follow him
the dead boys fingers are still entwined in mine but i cant pull him clear of the lake
he died here and so hes trapped here watching sorrowfully as im dragged to safety
im lying in the mud coughing water my body made of lead
daniel is floating face down in the lake
somebody slaps me
then again harder
annas hovering above me but everythings blurry
the lakes holding its hands over my ears tugging me back
darkness is calling me
she leans closer a smudge of a person
 find me screams anna the words faint 712 am in the entrance hall  beneath the lake thomas beckons me back and closing my eyes i join the drowned boy
53   day eight  my cheek is resting against the curve of a womans back
were naked tangled in sweatsoaked sheets on a dirty mattress rain wriggling through the rotten window frames to run down the wall and collect on the bare floorboards
she stirs as i do madeline aubert rolling over to meet me
the maids green eyes shine with a sickly need her dark hair stuck to her damp cheeks
she looks much as thomas hardcastle did in my dream drowned and desperate clinging to whatevers at hand
finding me lying beside her she drops her head on the pillow with a disappointed sigh
such obvious disdain should make me uncomfortable but any ruffled feathers are smoothed by the remembrance of our first meeting the shame of our mutual need and the eagerness with which she came into my arms when i pulled one of bells laudanum vials from my pocket
my eyes lazily search the cottage for more drugs
my work for the hardcastles is complete their new portraits hang in the long gallery
im not invited to the party and im not expected at the house leaving me a free morning on this mattress the world circling me like paint down a plughole
my gaze snags on madelines cap and apron which are hanging off a chair
as if slapped i immediately return to myself the uniform summoning annas face her voice and touch the peril of our situation
clinging to this memory i manage to elbow golds personality to one side
im so filled with his hopes and fears lusts and passions that aiden bishop had felt like a dream in the morning light
i believed i was no more than this
edging off the mattress i knock over a pile of empty laudanum vials which roll away across the floor like fleeing mice
kicking them aside i go to the fire where a single flame licks the embers swelling as i add more tinder and wood from the pile
chess pieces line the mantelpiece each of them handcrafted a few painted though splashed in colour might describe them better
theyre only half finished and lying beside them is the small knife gold is using to carve them
these are the chess pieces anna will spend the day carrying around and the blade is a perfect match for the slashes i saw on golds arms yesterday
fate is lighting signal fires again
madelines retrieving her clothes which are scattered across the floor
such haste speaks of an unruly passion though theres only shame at work within her now
she dresses with her back to me eyes on the wall opposite
golds gaze is not so chaste gorging on the sight of her pale white flesh her hair spilling down her back
do you have a mirror she asks doing up her dress the lightest touch of a french accent in her words
i dont believe so i say enjoying the warmth of the fire on my bare skin
i must look terrible she says absently
a gentleman would disagree out of respect but gold is no gentleman and madeline is no grace davies
ive never seen her without powder and makeup and im surprised by how sickly looking she appears
her face is desperately thin with yellow pockmarked skin and tired eyes rubbed raw
skirting along the far wall in order to stay as far away from me as possible she opens the door to leave cold air stealing the warmth from the room
its early still hours until dawn and theres fog on the ground
blackheath is framed by trees night still draped around its shoulders
given the angle im seeing it from this cottage must be somewhere out by the family graveyard
i watch madeline hurrying along the path towards the house a shawl pulled tight across her shoulders
if events had followed their original course it would be me stumbling into the night
driven mad by the footmans torture id have taken the carving knife to my own flesh before climbing blackheaths stairs to bang on dances door screaming my warning
by seeing through daniels betrayal and overwhelming him in the graveyard ive avoided that fate
ive rewritten the day
now i have to make sure it has a happy ending
closing the door behind madeline i light an oil lamp pondering my next move as the darkness slinks into the corners
ideas claw at the inside of my skull one last halfformed monster still waiting to be dragged into the brightness
to think when i woke up that first morning as bell i fretted about possessing too few memories
now i must contend with an overabundance
my mind is a stuffed trunk that needs unpacking but for gold the world only makes sense on canvas and its there i must find my answer
if rashton and ravencourt have taught me anything its to value my hosts talents rather than lament their limitations
picking up the lamp i head towards the studio at the back of the cottage to search for some paint
canvases are stacked against the walls the paintings halffinished or slashed in a fury
bottles of wine have been kicked over spilling across the floor onto hundreds of pencil sketches scrunched up and tossed aside
turpentine drips down the wall blurring a landscape gold seems to have begun in a flurry and abandoned in a rage
stacked at the centre of the squalor like a pyre awaiting the torch are dozens of old family portraits their woodwormriddled frames ripped off and tossed aside
most of the portraits have been destroyed by turpentine though a few pale limbs have managed to survive the purge
evelyn told me gold had been commissioned to touch up the art around blackheath
seems he wasnt terribly impressed with what he found
staring at the pile an idea begins to form
rummaging through the shelves i snatch up a charcoal stick and return to the front room placing the lamp on the floor
theres no canvas to hand so i dash my thoughts across the wall instead working within the small pool of dancing light cast by the lantern
they arrive in a frenzy a lurch of knowledge that wears the stick down to a nub in minutes forcing me into the gloom to scavenge another
working downwards from a canopy of names clustered near the ceiling i feverishly sketch a trunk of everybodys actions over the course of the day the roots stretching back nineteen years burrowing into a lake with a dead boy at the bottom
at some point i accidentally reopen an old cut on my hand smearing my tree red
tearing the sleeve from my shirt i bandage the wound as best i can before returning to my labour
the first rays of the new dawn creep over the horizon as i step back the charcoal stick dropping from my hand and shattering on the bare floorboards
exhausted i sit down in front of it my arm trembling
too little information and youre blind too much and youre blinded
i squint at the pattern
there are two knots in the tree representing two swirling holes in the story
two questions that will make sense of everything what did millicent derby know and where is helena hardcastle
the cottage door opens bringing the smell of dew
im too tired to look around
im melted candlewax formless and spent waiting for somebody to scrape me off the floor
all i want to do is sleep to close my eyes and free myself of all thought but this is my last host
if i fail everything starts over again
youre here says the plague doctor startled
youre never here
by this time youre usually raving
how did what is that he sweeps by me his greatcoat swishing
the costume is utterly ridiculous by the light of a new day the nightmarish bird revealed as a theatrical tramp
little wonder he makes most of his house calls at night
he stops inches from the wall running his gloved hand along the curve of the tree smudging the names
remarkable he says under his breath looking it up and down
what happened to silver tear i ask
i saw her shot in the graveyard  i trapped her in the loop he says sadly
it was the only way to save her life
shell wake up in a few hours thinking shes just arrived and repeat everything she did yesterday
my superiors will notice her absence eventually and come to free her
im afraid i have some difficult questions ahead of me  as he stands in communion with my painted tree i open the front door sunlight drawing across my face warmth spreading down my neck and bare arms
squinting into the glare i breathe in its golden light
ive never been awake this early before never seen the sun rise over this place
its miraculous
does this painting say what i think it says asks the plague doctor his voice tight with expectation
what do you believe it says  that michael hardcastle tried to murder his own sister  then yes thats what it says  birds are singing three rabbits hopping around the cottages small garden their fur made rustcoloured by the sunlight
if id known paradise was on the far side of a sunrise id never have wasted a single night on sleep
youve solved it mr bishop youre the first one to solve it he says his voice rising in excitement
youre free
after all this time youre finally free he removes a silver hip flask from the folds of his robe and presses it into my hand
i cant identify the liquid in the flask but it sets fire to my bones jolting me awake
silver tear was right to worry i say still watching the rabbits
im not leaving without anna  thats not your choice he says standing back to better see the tree
what are you going to do drag me out to the lake i ask
i wont need to he says
the lake was simply a meeting place
the answer was all that ever mattered
youve solved evelyns murder and convinced me of the solution
now that ive accepted it even blackheath cant keep hold of you
next time you sleep youll be freed  i want to be angry but i cant rouse myself to it
sleep is tugging at me with soft hands and every time i close my eyes it becomes that much harder to open them again
returning to the open door i slide my back down the frame until im sitting on the floor half of my body in gloom the other half in sunshine
i cant bring myself to abandon the warmth and birdsong the blessings of a world so long denied
i take another sip from the flask forcing myself awake
ive still got so much to do
so much you cant be seen to be doing
it wasnt a fair competition i say
i had eight hosts whereas anna and daniel only had one
i could remember the week and they couldnt  he pauses considering me
you had those things because you chose to come to blackheath he says quietly as if afraid of being overheard
they did not and thats all i can say on the matter  if i chose to come here once i can choose to come again i say
i wont leave anna behind  he begins to pace glancing between me and the painting
youre afraid i say surprised
yes im afraid he snaps
my superiors theyre not you shouldnt defy them
i promise you after you leave ill offer anna all the assistance its in my power to grant  one day one host
shell never escape blackheath you know she wont i say
i couldnt have done this without ravencourts intelligence and dances cunning
it was only because of rashton that i started looking at the clues like evidence
hell even derby and bell played their part
shell need all of their skills just as i did  your hosts will still be in blackheath  but i wont be controlling them i insist
they wont help a maid
ill be abandoning her to this place  forget about her
this has already gone on long enough he says swinging around to confront me swiping his hand through the air
whats gone on long enough  hes looking at his gloved hand startled by his own loss of control
only you can make me this angry he says in a quieter voice
its always been the same
loop after loop host after host
ive seen you betray friends make alliances and die on principle
ive seen so many versions of aiden bishop youd probably never recognise yourself in them but the one thing thats never changed is your stubbornness
you pick a path and you walk down it until the end no matter how many holes you fall down along the way
it would be impressive if it werent so intensely irritating  irritating or not i have to know why silver tear went to such lengths to try to kill anna  he offers me a long appraising look and then sighs
do you know how you can tell if a monsters fit to walk the world again mr bishop he says contemplatively
if theyre truly redeemed and not just telling you what you want to hear he takes another slug from the hip flask
you give them a day without consequences and you watch to see what they do with it  my skin prickles my blood running cold
this was all a test i say slowly
we prefer to call it rehabilitation  rehabilitation i repeat understanding rising within me like the sun over the house
this is a prison  yes except instead of leaving our prisoners to rot in a cell we give them a chance to prove themselves worthy of release every single day
do you see the beauty of it the murder of evelyn hardcastle was never solved and probably never would have been
by locking prisoners inside the murder we give them a chance to atone for their own crimes by solving somebody elses
its as much a service as a punishment  are there other places like this i say trying to wrap my head around it
thousands he says
ive seen a village that wakes up each morning with three headless bodies in the square and a series of murders on an ocean liner
there must be fifteen prisoners attempting to solve that one  which makes you what
a warden  an assessor
i decide if youre worthy of release  but you said i chose to come to blackheath
why would i choose to come to a prison  you came for anna but you got trapped and loop after loop blackheath picked you apart until you forgot yourself as it was designed to his voice is tight with anger his gloved hands clenched
my superiors should never have let you inside it was wrong
for the longest time i thought the innocent man whod entered here was lost sacrificed in some futile gesture but youve found your way back
thats why ive been helping you
i gave you control of different hosts searching for those who were best equipped to solve her murder finally settling on the eight of today
i experimented with their order to ensure you got the best out of them
i even arranged to have mr rashton hidden in that cupboard to keep him alive
im bending every rule possible so that you can finally escape
do you see now
you must leave while youre still the person you wish to be  and anna i say haltingly hating the question im about to ask
ive never allowed myself to believe that anna belonged here preferring to think of this place as the equivalent of being shipwrecked or struck by lightning
by assuming her to be a victim i took away the niggling doubt of whether this was deserved but without that comfort my fear is growing
what did anna do to deserve blackheath i ask
he shakes his head passing me the flask
thats not for me to say
just know that the weight of the punishment is equal to the crime
the prisoners i told you about in the village and on the boat received lighter sentences than either anna or daniel
those places are much less harrowing than here
blackheath was built to break devils not petty thieves  youre saying annas a devil  im saying thousands of crimes are committed every day but only two people have been sent to this place his voice is rising racked with emotion
annas one of them and yet you risked your life to help her escape
its madness  any woman who can inspire that loyalty has to be worth something  youre not hearing me he says his fists balled
im hearing you but i wont leave her here i say
even if you make me go today ill find my way back in tomorrow
i did it once ill do it again  stop being such a bloody fool he thumps the doorframe hard enough to bring dust down on our heads
it wasnt loyalty that brought you to blackheath it was vengeance
you didnt come here to rescue anna you came for your pound of flesh
shes safe in blackheath
caged but safe
you didnt want her to be caged you wanted her to suffer – so many people out there wanted her to suffer but none of them was willing to do what you were because nobody hated this woman as much as you did
you followed her into blackheath and for thirty years you dedicated yourself to torturing her as the footman tortures you today  silence presses down on us
i open my mouth to respond but my stomachs in my shoes my head spinning
the world has upended itself and even though im sitting on the floor i can feel myself falling and falling
what did she do i whisper
my superiors  opened blackheaths doors to an innocent man intent on murder i say
theyre as guilty as anybody in here
now tell me what she did  i cant he says weakly his resistance all but spent
youve helped me this far  yes because what happened to you is wrong he says taking a long swig from the flask his adams apple bouncing up and down in his throat
nobody objected to my helping you escape because you werent supposed to be here anyway but if i start telling you things you shouldnt know therell be repercussions
for both of us  i cant leave without knowing why im going and i cant promise not to come back until im certain of why i came in the first place i say
please this is how we end this  the beak mask turns towards me slowly and for a full minute he stands there deep in thought
i can feel myself being measured my qualities weighed and set aside my flaws held up to the light that they might be better judged
its not you hes measuring
what does that mean
hes a good man
this is when he finds out how good
bowing his head the plague doctor surprises me by taking off his top hat revealing the brown leather straps holding the beak mask in place
one by one he begins undoing them grunting with the effort as his thick fingers pry at the catches
as the last clasp comes loose he removes his mask and pulls down his hood revealing the bald head beneath
hes older than i would have imagined closer to sixty than fifty certainly his face that of a decent overworked man
his eyes are bloodshot his skin the colour of old paper
if my tiredness could take a shape it would look like this
oblivious to my concern he tilts his face to catch the early morning light seeping through the window
well thats done it he says tossing the mask onto golds bed
freed from the porcelain his voice is almost but not quite the one i know
i dont imagine you were supposed to do that i nod towards the mask
its getting to be quite a list he replies sitting down on a step outside the door positioning himself so that his entire body is bathed in sunlight
i come here every morning before i start work he says taking a deep breath
i love this time of the day
it lasts for seventeen minutes then the clouds gather and two footmen resume a quarrel from the evening before ending in a fistfight at the stables hes peeling his gloves off finger by finger
its a shame this is the first time youve been able to enjoy it mr bishop  aiden i say extending my hand
oliver he says as he shakes it
oliver i repeat thoughtfully
i never thought of you having a name  perhaps i should tell it to donald davies when i confront him on the road he says a faint smile on his lips
hell be very angry
it might calm him  youre still going out there
why
you have your answer  until you escape its my duty to shepherd those that follow you to give them the same chance you had  but you know who killed evelyn hardcastle now i say
wont that change things  are you suggesting ill find my task difficult because i know more than them he shakes his head
ive always known more than them
i knew more than you
knowledge was never my problem
ignorance is the condition i struggle with  his face hardens again the levity slipping from his tone
thats why ive taken my mask off aiden
i need you to see my face and hear my voice and know that what im telling you is the absolute truth
we cant have doubts between us any more  i understand i say
its all i can manage
i feel like a man waiting for the fall
the name annabelle caulker the woman you know as anna is a curse in every language in which it is spoken he says pinning me in place with his gaze
she was the leader of a group which sowed destruction and death across half the nations of the world and would surely still be doing so if she hadnt been caught over thirty years ago
thats who youre trying to free  i should be surprised
i should be shocked or angry
i should protest but i dont feel any of those things
this doesnt feel like a revelation more the voicing of facts ive long been familiar with
annas fierce and fearless even brutal when she needs to be
i saw her expression in the gatehouse when she came at dance with the shotgun not realising it was me
she would have pulled the trigger without any regret at all
she killed daniel when i could not and casually suggested murdering evelyn ourselves as a way of answering the plague doctors question
she said it was a joke but even now im not certain
and yet anna only killed those people to protect me buying time so that i could solve this mystery
shes strong shes kind and she stayed loyal even when my desire to save evelyn threatened to undermine our investigation into her murder
of all the people in the house shes the only one who never hid who she truly was
shes not that person any more i argue
you said blackheath was meant to rehabilitate people to break down their old personalities and test the new ones
well ive seen anna up close this last week
shes helped me saved my life more than once
shes my friend  she murdered your sister he says bluntly
my world empties
she tortured her humiliated her and made the world watch he continues
thats who anna is and people like that dont change aiden  i drop to my knees clutching my temples as old memories erupt
my sister was called juliette
she had brown hair and a bright smile
she was charged with capturing annabelle caulker and i was so proud of her
every recollection feels like a shard of glass tearing through my mind
juliette was driven and clever and thought justice was something that had to be defended and not simply expected
she made me laugh
she thought that was worth doing
tears roll down my cheeks
annabelle caulkers men came in the night and took juliette from her home
they executed her husband with a single bullet to the head
he was lucky
juliettes bullet didnt come for seven days
they tortured her and let everybody watch
they called it justice for their persecution
they said we should have expected this
i dont know anything more about myself or the rest of my family
i didnt keep hold of my happy memories
only those that could help me only hate and grief
it was juliettes murder that brought me to blackheath
it was the weekly phone calls that stopped coming
the stories we stopped sharing
it was the space where she should have been and would never be again
it was the way annabelle was eventually caught
bloodlessly
painlessly
entirely without incident
and they sent her to blackheath where my sisters murderer would spend a lifetime solving the death of a murdered sister
they called it justice
they patted themselves on the back for their ingenuity thinking id be as pleased as they were
thinking it was enough
they were wrong
the injustice tore into me at night and stalked me during the day
it whittled me down until she was the only thing i could think about
i followed her through the gates of hell
i pursued terrified and tortured annabelle caulker until i forgot the reasons why
until i forgot juliette
until annabelle became anna and all i saw was a terrified girl at the mercy of monsters
i became the thing i hated and made annabelle into the thing i loved
and i blamed blackheath
i look up at the plague doctor through eyes raw with tears
hes looking me full in the face weighing my reaction
i wonder what he sees because i have no idea what to think
all of this is happening to me because of the person im trying to save
this is annas fault
annabelle
what i ask surprised by how insistent the voice in my head sounds
its annabelle caulkers fault not annas
thats who we hated
aiden asks the plague doctor
and annabelle caulkers dead
annabelle caulkers dead i repeat slowly meeting the plague doctors startled gaze
he shakes his head
youre wrong  it took thirty years i say
and it wasnt done with violence and it wasnt done with hatred
it was done with forgiveness
annabelle caulker is dead  youre mistaken  no you are i say building in confidence
you asked me to listen to the voice in my head and i am
you asked me to believe blackheath could rehabilitate people and i have
now you need to do the same because youre so blinded by who anna used to be youre ignoring who shes become and if youre not willing to accept shes changed then what good is any of this  frustrated he kicks at the dirt with the toe of his boot
i should never have taken the mask off he growls getting to his feet and striding into the garden scattering the rabbits that had been eating the grass
hands on hips he stares at blackheath in the distance and for the first time i realise its as much his master as mine
while i was free to tinker and change hes been forced to watch murder rape and suicide wrapped in enough lies to bury the entire place
hes had to accept whatever the day brought him no matter how horrific
and unlike me he wasnt allowed to forget
a man could go mad
most men would unless they had faith
unless they believed the ends justified the means
as if privy to my thoughts the plague doctor turns towards me
what is it youre asking of me aiden  come to the lake at eleven i say firmly
therell be a monster there and i guarantee it wont be anna
watch her give her a chance to prove herself
youll see who she really is and youll see im right  he looks uncertain
how can you know that he asks
because ill be in danger  even if you convince me shes rehabilitated youve already solved the mystery of evelyns death he says
the rules are clear the first prisoner to explain who killed evelyn hardcastle will be released
thats you
not anna
whats your solution to that  getting to my feet i stumble over to my sketch of the tree jabbing at the knots the holes in my knowledge
i havent solved everything i say
if michael hardcastle planned to shoot his sister in the reflecting pool why would he also poison her
i dont think he did
i dont think he knew there was poison in the drink that killed him
i think somebody else put it there in case michael failed  the plague doctors followed me inside
thats thin reasoning aiden  we still have too many questions for anything else i say recalling evelyns pale face after i saved her in the sun room and the message she worked so hard to deliver
if this was finished why would evelyn tell me millicent derby was murdered
what does that achieve  perhaps michael killed her also  and what was his motive
no were missing something  what sort of something he asks his conviction wavering
i think michael hardcastle was working with somebody else somebody whos kept out of sight all along i say
a second killer he says taking a second to consider it
ive been here for thirty years and ive never suspected nobody ever has
it cant be aiden
its impossible  everything about today is impossible i say thumping my charcoal tree
theres a second killer i know there is
i have an idea who it may be and if im right they killed millicent derby to cover their tracks
theyre as implicated in evelyns murder as michael and that means you need two answers
if anna delivers michaels partner will that be enough to set her free i ask
my superiors do not want to see annabelle caulker leave blackheath he says
and im not certain they can be convinced shes changed
even if they can theyll be looking for any excuse to keep her imprisoned aiden  you helped me because i dont belong here i say
if im right about anna the same is now true for her  running his hand across his scalp he paces back and forth casting anxious glances between myself and the sketch
i can only promise ill be at the lake tonight with an open mind he says
its enough i say clapping him on the shoulder
meet me by the boathouse at eleven and youll see im right  and may i ask what youll be doing in the meantime  im going to find out who murdered millicent derby      54   keeping to the trees i approach blackheath unseen my shirt damp with fog my shoes caked in mud
the sun room lies a few paces away and crouching among the dripping bushes i look for any movement within
its still early but i dont know when daniel wakes up or when hes recruited by silver tear
for safetys sake i must assume he and his spies are still a threat which means i must remain concealed until hes lying face down in the lake all his plots drowned with him
after the suns early foray its abandoned us to the gloom the sky a muddle of greys
i search the flower beds for splashes of red hints of purple pink or white
i search for the brighter world behind this one imagining blackheath alight wearing a crown of flames and a cape of fire
i see the grey sky burning black ash falling like snow
i imagine the world remade if only for an instant
i come to a halt suddenly uncertain of my purpose
i look around not recognising anything wondering why i left the cottage without my brushes and easel
surely i came to paint but im not a fan of the morning light here
its too dreary too quiet a gauze across the landscape
i dont know why im here i say to myself looking down at my charcoalstained shirt
anna
youre here for anna
her name shakes me loose of golds confusion my memories returning in a flood
its getting worse
taking a deep breath of cold air i clutch the chess piece from the mantel in my hand building a wall between myself and gold by using every memory i have of anna
i make bricks of her laughter her touch her kindness and warmth and only when im content my wall is high enough do i resume my study of the sun room letting myself inside when im satisfied the house sleeps
dances drunken friend philip sutcliffe is asleep on one of the couches his jacket drawn up over his face
he stirs briefly smacking his lips and peering at me blearily
he murmurs something shifts his weight and then falls asleep again
i wait listening
dripping
breathing heavily
nothing else moves
evelyns grandmother watches me from the portrait above the fireplace
her lips are pursed the artist capturing her exactly at the moment of rebuke
my neck prickles
i find myself frowning at the painting dismayed by how gently shes been rendered
my mind repaints it the curves as harsh as scars the oil piled like mountains
it becomes a mood smeared on canvas
a black one at that
im certain the old battleaxe would have preferred its honesty
a peal of shrill laughter sounds through the open door a dagger driven into somebodys story
the guests must have started drifting down to breakfast
im running out of time
closing my eyes i try to remember what millicent spoke with her son about what drove her to hurry off so quickly and come here but everythings a clutter
there are too many days too many conversations
a gramophone springs into life down the corridor slashing at the quiet with random notes
theres a crash the music screeching to a halt hushed voices bickering and blaming
we were standing outside the ballroom thats where it started
millicent was sad wrapped in memory
we talked of the past how shed visited blackheath as a child and brought her own children when they were old enough
she was disappointed in them then angry with me
she caught me looking through the ballroom window at evelyn and mistook my concern for lust
its always the weak ones with you isnt it she said
always the  something she saw caused her to lose her train of thought
squeezing my eyes shut i try to recall what it was
who else was in there with evelyn
half a second later im sprinting into the corridor towards the gallery
a single oil lamps burning on the wall its sickly flame encouraging the shadows rather than diminishing them
snatching it off the hook i hold it up to the family oil paintings inspecting them one by one
blackheath shrinks around me shrivelling like a spider touched to the flame
in a few hours millicent will see something in the ballroom that so startles her shell leave her son standing on the path and rush to this gallery
wrapped in scarves and armed with her suspicions shell spot golds new paintings among the older ones
any other time she might have walked past
maybe she has during a hundred other loops but not on this occasion
this time the past will hold her hand and squeeze
memory will murder her
55   its 712 am and the entrance hall is a mess
smashed decanters litter the marble floor portraits hang at odd angles lipstick kisses planted on the mouths of longdead men
bow ties dangle from the chandelier like sleeping bats and at the centre of it all stands anna barefoot in her white cotton nightgown staring at her hands as though theyre a riddle she cant make sense of
she hasnt noticed me and for a few seconds i watch her trying to reconcile my anna with the plague doctors stories of annabelle caulker
i wonder if annas hearing caulkers voice right now the way i heard aiden bishops that first morning
something dry and distant a part of her yet apart at the same time impossible to ignore
to my shame my faith in my friend wavers
after working so hard to convince the plague doctor of annas innocence now im the one looking at her askew questioning whether any part of the monster who murdered my sister has survived waiting to surface again
annabelle caulkers dead
now help her
anna i say softly suddenly wary of my own appearance
gold spent most of his evening in a laudanumfuelled fug my only concession to hygiene being a splash of water on his face before i came charging out of the cottage
goodness knows how i must appear to her or smell
she looks up at me startled
do i know you she asks
you will i say
this might help  i toss her the chess piece i took from the cottage which she catches in one hand
opening her palm she stares down at it memory setting light to her face
without warning she flings herself into my arms wet tears seeping through my shirt
aiden she says her mouth against my chest
she smells of milky soap and bleach her hair catching in my whiskers
i remember you i remember  i feel her stiffen her arms falling loose
disentangling herself she pushes me away grabbing a piece of shattered glass from the floor to use as a weapon
it trembles in her hand
you murdered me she snarls gripping the glass tight enough to draw blood
yes i did i say the knowledge of what she did to my sister hanging on my lips
annabelle caulkers dead
and im sorry about that i continue stuffing my hands into my pockets
i promise it wont happen again  for a second all she can do is blink at me
im not the man you remember any more i say
it was a different life a different set of choices
a lot of mistakes ive tried not to make again and havent because of you i think  dont she says thrusting the glass shard at me when i take a step towards her
i cant
i remember things i know things  there are rules i say
evelyn hardcastle is going to die and were going to save her together
i have a way we can both get out of here  we cant both escape its not allowed she insists
thats one of the rules isnt it  allowed or not were going to do it i say
you have to trust me  i cant she says fiercely wiping a stray tear from her cheek with her thumb
you killed me
i remember it
i can still feel the shot
i was so excited to see you aiden
i thought we were finally leaving
you and me together  we are  you killed me  it wasnt the first time i say my voice cracked by regret
weve both hurt each other anna and weve both paid for it
im never going to betray you again i promise
you can trust me
you already have trusted me you just cant remember it  raising my hands as if surrendering i move slowly towards the staircase
brushing away a broken pair of glasses and some confetti i sit down on the red carpet
every host is pressing down upon me their memories of this room crowding the edges of my mind their weight almost too much to bear
clear as the morning it happened –  this is the morning it happened  – i recall bells conversation with the butler at the door and how afraid they both were
my hand throbs from the pain of ravencourts cane as he struggled towards the library shortly before jim rashton heaved a sack of stolen drugs out through the front door
i hear the light steps of donald davies on the marble as he fled the house after his first meeting with the plague doctor and the laughter of edward dances friends even as he stood silent
so many memories and secrets so many burdens
every life has such weight
i dont know how anybody carries even one
whats wrong with you asks anna creeping closer the glass shard held a little looser in her hand
you dont look well  ive got eight different people rattling around in here i say tapping my temple
eight  eight versions of today as well i say
every time i wake up im in a different guest
this is my last one
either i solve this today or i start all over again tomorrow  thats not the rules wont let you
we only get one day to solve the murder and you cant be anybody else
thats its not right  the rules dont apply to me  why  because i chose to come here i say rubbing my tired eyes
i came here for you  youre trying to rescue me she says incredulously the glass shard dangling by her side forgotten
something like that  but you murdered me  i never said i was very good at it  perhaps its my tone or the way im slouching on the step but anna lets the glass shard drop to the floor and sits beside me
i can feel the warmth of her the solidity
shes the only real thing in a world of echoes
are you still trying she asks peering up at me through big brown eyes her skin pale and puffy streaked with tears
to rescue me i mean  im trying to rescue us both but i cant do it without your help i say
you have to believe me anna im not the man who hurt you  i want to she falters shaking her head
how can i trust you  you just have to start i say shrugging
we dont have time for anything else  she nods taking that in
and what would you need me to do if i could start to trust you  a lot of small favours and two big ones i say
what are the big ones  i need you to save my life
twice
this will help  from my pocket i take out the artists sketchbook a battered old thing filled with crumpled pieces of looseleaf paper the leather covers bound with string
i found it in golds jacket when i left the cottage
after tossing away golds somewhat anarchic sketches i wrote down everything i could remember about my hosts schedules leaving notes and instructions dotted throughout
what is it she asks taking it from me
its the book of me i say
and its the only advantage we have      56   have you seen gold
he should already be here  im sitting in sutcliffes empty bedroom the door opened a crack
daniel is busy speaking with bell in the room opposite and annas outside pacing furiously
its not my intention to make her fret but after i finished scattering letters across the house including the one in the library revealing cunninghams parentage i retired here with a decanter of whisky from the drawing room
ive been drinking solidly for an hour trying to wash away the shame of whats coming and though im drunk im not nearly drunk enough
whats our plan i hear rashton say to anna
we need to keep the footman from killing the butler and gold this morning she says
theyve still got a role to play in all this assuming we can keep them alive long enough  i take another slug of the whisky listening to them talk
gold doesnt have a drop of violence in him and it would take a great deal of convincing to make him hurt an innocent man
i dont have time for that so im hoping to numb him instead
ive not having any luck so far
gold beds other mens wives cheats at dice and generally carries on as though the sky is going to fall any minute but he wouldnt crush a wasp that stung him
he loves life too much to bring pain to anybody elses which is unfortunate because pain is the only thing that will keep the butler alive long enough to meet anna in the gatehouse
hearing his dragging steps outside the door i take a breath and stride into the corridor obstructing his path
through golds strange eyes hes a beautiful sight his burnt face a joy so much more engaging than the bland symmetry of most people
he tries to back away from me with a hurried apology but i snatch his wrist
he looks up at me mistaking my mood
he sees anger when all i feel is anguish
i have no desire to hurt this man yet i must
he tries to move around me but i block his path
i despise what i must do wishing i could explain but there isnt time
even so i cant bring myself to raise the poker and strike an innocent man
i keep seeing him lying in bed swaddled in white cotton sheets beaten black and blue struggling to breathe
if you dont do this daniel wins
just his name is enough to stir my hate my fists balling by my sides
i think of his duplicity fanning the flames of my rage by remembering every lie he told me drowning all over again with the little boy in the lake
i remember the feeling of the footmans knife as it slipped between derbys ribs and slashed dances throat
the surrender he forced on rashton
with a roar i vent my anger striking the butler with the poker i took from the fireplace catching him across the back of the shoulders sending him crashing into the wall and down onto the floor
please he says trying to slide away from me
im not  he wheezes for help holding out an imploring hand
its the hand that pushes me over the edge
daniel did something similar by the lake turning my own pity upon me
now its daniel i see on the floor and my anger catches fire boiling in my veins
i kick him
once then again and again and again
reason deserts me rage pouring into the void
every betrayal every pain and sorrow every regret every disappointment every humiliation every anguish every hurt all of them theyre filling me up
i can barely breathe barely see
im sobbing as i kick him over and over
i pity this man
i pity myself
i hear rashton an instant before he hits me with the vase
the crash echoes inside my skull as i fall and fall the ground catching me in its hard arms
57   day two continued  aiden  the voice is distant washing over my body like water lapping a beach
god wake up
please wake up  wearily ever so wearily my eyes flicker open
im staring at a cracked wall my head resting on a white pillowcase spattered with red blood
tiredness reaches for me threatening to drag me back under
much to my surprise im the butler again lying in that bed in the gatehouse
stay awake
stay still
were in trouble
i move my body a fraction the pain in my side leaping as far as my mouth before i bite it back trapping a scream in my throat
if nothing else its enough to wake me up
blood has soaked the sheets where the footman stabbed me earlier
the agony must have been enough to knock me unconscious but not enough to kill me
surely thats no accident
the footman has ushered a lot of people into the afterlife and i doubt he got lost this time
the idea chills me
i thought nothing was more frightening than somebody trying to kill me
turns out its more a matter of whos doing the killing and when thats the footman being left alive is far more terrifying
aiden are you awake  i turn over painfully to see anna in the corner of the room legs and hands tied by a length of rope which is knotted around an old radiator
her cheek is swollen a black eye blossoming on her face like a flower in the snow
night shows through the window above her but i dont have any clue what time it is
for all i know its already eleven and the plague doctor is waiting for us by the lake
seeing me awake anna lets out a sob of relief
i thought hed killed you she says
that makes two of us i croak
he grabbed me outside the house told me hed kill me if i didnt come with him she says struggling against her bonds
i knew donald davies was safely asleep on that road and that he couldnt reach him so i did what he asked
im so sorry aiden but i couldnt think of another way  shell betray you
this is what the plague doctor warned me about the decision rashton mistook for evidence of annas duplicity
that lack of trust nearly sabotaged everything weve been working for throughout the day
i wonder if the plague doctor knew the circumstances of annas betrayal hiding them for his own ends or whether he genuinely believed this woman had turned against me
its not your fault anna i say
im still sorry she flicks a frightened glance at the door then lowers her voice
can you reach the shotgun
he put it on the sideboard  i glance across towards it
its only a few feet away but it might as well be on the moon
i could barely roll over let alone stand up to get it
awake are you interrupts the footman who emerges through the door slicing chunks off an apple with his pocket knife
thats a shame i was looking forward to waking you up again  theres another man behind him
its the thug from the graveyard the one who held my arms while daniel tried to beat annas location out of me
the footman approaches the bed
last time we met i let you live he says
had to be done but still it was unsatisfying clearing his throat i feel a wet splat of saliva hit my cheek
disgust echoes through me but i havent the strength to lift my arm and wipe it away
wont happen a second time he says
i dont like people waking up again
feels like a job half done
i want donald davies and i want you to tell me where i can lay my hands on him  my mind whirls connecting the giant jigsaw pieces of my life
daniel found me on the road after i jumped out of the carriage and convinced me to follow him into the graveyard
i never questioned how he knew where id be but here is my answer anyway
in a few minutes im going to tell the footman
if i wasnt so afraid id smile at the irony
daniel believes im betraying davies to his death but without their confrontation in the graveyard ill never find out silver tear is in blackheath or fight daniel by the lake allowing anna to finally finish him off
its a trap all right
one built by rashton sprung by davies and baited by me
its as neat as youd like except that when i tell the footman what he wants to know hell butcher anna and me like cattle
placing his knife and the apple on the sideboard beside the shotgun the footman picks up the sleeping tablets the jar rattling as he shakes a pill into his hand
i can almost hear him frowning at it his thoughts thudding back and forth
his companion is still at the door arms folded and expressionless
the jar rattles again
once twice three times
how many of these things does it take to kill a burnt cripple like you eh he asks gripping my chin with his hand and forcing my face towards his own
i try to turn away but his grip hardens his eyes fastening on mine
i can feel the heat of him his malice a prickly hot thing crawling along my skin
i could have woken up behind that gaze
i could have shared that rats warren of a brain wading through memories and impulses id never have been able to shake off
maybe i did in a past loop
suddenly even the loathsome derby seems like a blessing
his iron fingers release me my head lolling to one side beads of perspiration welling on my forehead
i dont know how much longer i have
judging by those burns youve had a hard life he says withdrawing a little
hard life deserves an easy death i reckon
thats what im offering
fall asleep with a belly full of pills or writhe around for a couple of hours while i keep missing the important bits with my knife  leave him alone anna screams from the corner the wood creaking as she strains to break free
better yet he says waving his knife at her
i could take my blade to the girl here
i need her alive
doesnt mean she cant scream a bit first  he takes a step towards her
stables i say quietly
he stops dead looking at me over his shoulder
what did you say  he walks back over to me
close your eyes dont let him see your fear
thats what he craves
he wont kill you until you open your eyes
squeezing them shut i feel the bed sag as he sits down
a few seconds later the edge of his blade caresses my face
fear tells me to open my eyes to see the harm coming
just breathe wait for your moment
donald davies will be at the stables he hisses
is that what you said  i nod trying to ward off panic
leave him alone anna screams again from the corner pounding the floorboards with her heels and pulling violently against the ropes restraining her
shut up the footman screams at her before returning his attention to me
when  my mouth is so dry im not even sure i can still speak
when he insists the blade biting my cheek drawing blood
twenty to ten i say remembering the time daniel gave me
go
thats ten minutes from now he tells the man at the door fading steps charting the thugs departure down the corridor
the blade wanders along the edge of my lips tracing the contours of my nose until i feel the slightest pressure on my closed eyelid
open your eyes he hisses
i wonder if he can hear my heart beating
how could he not
its pounding like mortar fire wearing down what little bravery remains to me
i begin to tremble ever so slightly
open your eyes he repeats spittle hitting my cheeks
open your eyes little rabbit let me see inside  wood snaps and anna screams
i cant help but look
shes managed to rip the radiator from one of its brackets freeing her hands in the process though not her legs
the knife withdraws as the footman leaps to his feet the bedsprings squeaking as theyre relieved of his weight
now
move now
i throw myself at him
theres no skill in it no strength just desperation and momentum
a hundred other times i fail and my body hits him like a blown rag but theres something about the angle hes standing at and the way hes holding the knife
i catch the handle perfectly turning it and pushing the blade into his stomach blood welling up between my fingers as we hit the floor in a tangled pile
hes gasping stunned hurt even but not fatally so
already hes gathering himself
i look down at the knife only the hilt now visible and i know its not going to be enough
hes too strong and im too weak
anna i yell ripping the knife free and skimming it across the floor towards her watching in despair as it comes to a halt a few inches from her straining fingertips
the footman claws at me nails raking across my cheeks as he scrabbles desperately for my throat
the weight of my body pins his right hand my shoulder crushing his face blinding him
hes writhing grunting trying to shake me off
i cant hold him i scream at anna
his hand finds my ear and he wrenches at it my eyes filled with blinding white pain
i jerk away banging into the sideboard knocking the shotgun to the floor
the footmans hand breaks free from underneath me
he pushes me off him and as i hit the floorboards i see anna reaching for the shotgun the freshly severed rope still trailing from her wrist
our eyes meet fury gathered on her face
the footmans hands wrap themselves around my neck and tighten
i strike at his broken nose causing him to howl in pain but he doesnt let go
he squeezes harder choking
the shotgun explodes and so does the footman his headless body collapsing beside me blood pouring from his neck and spreading across the floor
i stare at the shotgun trembling in annas hands
if it hadnt fallen when it did if the knife hadnt reached her or shed been a few seconds later freeing herself
i shiver horrified at the margins between life and death
annas talking to me worrying about me but im so exhausted i only hear half of whats she saying and the last thing i feel before the darkness takes me is her hand in mine and the soft touch of her lips as they kiss my forehead
58   day eight continued  fighting through the thick fog of sleep i announce myself with a cough startling anna whos standing on her tiptoes her body pressed against mine as she tries to cut me loose with a kitchen knife
im back in gold strung up from the ceiling by my wrists
ill have you down in a tick says anna
she must have come straight from the room next door because her apron is covered in the footmans blood
brow furrowed she saws at the rope her haste making her clumsy
swearing she slows down but after a few minutes my bonds are slack enough for me to wriggle my hands free
i drop like a stone hitting the floor with a thud
easy says anna kneeling beside me
youve been tied up all day theres no strength left in you  what a hacking cough overtakes me but theres no water in the jug to ease it
the plague doctor wasted it all trying to keep me awake earlier
my shirts still wet from where he splashed me
i wait for the coughing to ease then try speaking again
what time i force out feeling as though im pushing stones up through my throat
its 945 says anna
if youve killed the footman he cant kill rashton or derby
theyre alive
they can help
dont need them i rasp
need who says anna
i shake my head gesturing for her to help me up
we have to  another painful cough another look of sympathy from anna
sit a second for pitys sake she says handing me a folded piece of paper thats fallen from my breast pocket
if she looked inside shed see the phrase all of them written in golds dreadful handwriting
those words are the key to everything thats happening and theyve been following me around since cunningham delivered the message to derby three days ago
tucking the note back into my pocket i gesture for anna to help me stand
somewhere in the darkness the plague doctor is making his way towards the lake where hell be expecting anna to give him an answer she doesnt yet have
after eight days of asking questions we now have a little over an hour to make our case
with my arm around annas shoulders and hers around my waist we stumble through the door drunkenly almost falling down the stairs
im very weak but the greater problem lies in how numb my limbs are
i feel like a wooden puppet on the end of twisted strings
we depart the gatehouse without a backwards glance smacking straight into the cold night air
the quickest route to the lake would take us past the wishing well but theres too great a chance of bumping into daniel and donald davies by going that way
i have no desire to upset whatever delicate balance weve arrived at by blundering into an event thats already been settled in my favour
well have to go the long way around
prickly with sweat leadenfooted and gasping i stagger up the driveway towards blackheath
my chorus comes with me dance derby and rashton out ahead bell collins and ravencourt struggling behind
i know theyre figments of my fracturing mind but i can see them as clearly as reflections their individual gaits their eagerness and disdain for the task before us
veering off the driveway we follow the cobbled road to the stables
its quiet there now the partys in full swing a few stable hands warming themselves around the braziers waiting for the last of the carriages to arrive
they look done in but uncertain of whos in daniels employ i tug anna away from the light and towards the paddock following the small trail leading up to the lake
a dying flame flickers at the end of the path its warm glow breaking through the gaps in the trees
creeping closer i see that its daniels fallen lantern burning its last breaths in the dirt
squinting into the darkness i spot its owner in the lake holding donald davies face down beneath the water the younger man thrashing his legs as he tries to escape
scooping a rock off the ground anna takes a step towards them but i catch her arm
tell him 712 am i croak hoping the intensity of my gaze can carry a message my throat is unfit to elaborate on
she bounds towards daniel raising the rock above her head as she goes
turning my back i pick up the fallen storm lantern stoking the sickly flame with a hoarse breath
i have no urge to watch somebody else die no matter how much they may deserve it
the plague doctor claimed blackheath was meant to rehabilitate us but bars cant build better men and misery can only break what goodness remains
this place pinches out the hope in people and without that hope what use is love or compassion or kindness
whatever the intention behind its creation blackheath speaks to the monster in us and i have no intention of indulging mine any longer
its had free rein long enough
lifting the lantern into the air i peel away towards the boathouse
all day ive been looking for helena hardcastle believing her responsible for the events in the house
strange to think i was probably right though not in the way i imagined
whether she intended it or not shes the reason all of this is happening
the boathouse is little more than a shed overhanging the water the stilts along the righthand side collapsed twisting the entire building out of shape
the doors are locked but the wood is so rotten it crumbles beneath my touch
theyll open with the slightest force but still i hesitate
my hand is shaking the light bouncing
its not fear that gives me pause golds heart is still as a stone
its expectation
something long sought is about to be found and when that happens all this will be over
well be free
taking a deep breath i push the doors open disturbing some bats which flee the boathouse in a chorus of indignant squeaks
a couple of skeletal rowing boats are tethered inside
only one of them is covered in a mouldy blanket though
kneeling down i pull it aside revealing helena hardcastles pale face
her eyes are open the pupils as colourless as her skin
she seems surprised as though death arrived with flowers in its hand
why here
because history repeats i mutter
aiden anna yells a slight note of panic in her voice
i try to shout back but my throat is still hoarse forcing me outside into the rain
i tip my mouth to the falling rain swallowing the freezing cold drops
over here i call out
in the boathouse  stepping back inside i run my lantern up and down helenas body
her long coat is unbuttoned revealing a rustcoloured woollen jacket and skirt with a white cotton blouse beneath
her hat has been tossed into the boat beside her
she was stabbed in the throat long enough ago for the blood to have coagulated
if im right shes been dead since this morning
anna arrives behind me gasping as she catches sight of the body in the boat
is that  helena hardcastle i say
how did you know shed be here she asks
this was the last appointment she kept i explain
the gash in her neck isnt large but its large enough exactly the size of a horseshoe knife i shouldnt wonder
the same weapon used to kill thomas hardcastle nineteen years ago
here finally is what this is all about
every other death was an echo of this one
a murder nobody heard
my legs are aching with the strain of crouching so i stand up and stretch them out
did michael do this asks anna clutching my coat
no this wasnt michael i say
michael hardcastle was afraid
he became a killer out of desperation
this murder was something else it took patience and pleasure
helena was lured here and stabbed at the door so shed collapse inside out of sight
the killer picked a spot not twenty feet from where thomas hardcastle was killed on the very anniversary of his death
what does that tell you  as i speak i imagine lady hardcastle falling hearing the crack of wood as she lands in the boat
a shadowy figure looms in my thoughts drawing the blanket across the body before wading into the water
the killer was covered in blood i say sweeping the lantern across the room
they washed themselves in the water knowing they were concealed by the walls of the boathouse
they had fresh clothes waiting  sure enough theres an old carpet bag in the corner and undoing the catch i discover a mound of bloody womens clothes inside
the murderers clothes
this was planned   a long time ago for another victim
who did this aiden asks anna fear rising in her voice
i step out of the boathouse searching the darkness until i spot a storm lantern on the far side of the lake
expecting company she asks her gaze fixed on the growing light
its the murderer i say feeling oddly calm
i had cunningham spread a rumour we were coming out here to well use the boathouse so to speak  why says anna terrified
if you know who helped michael tell the plague doctor  i cant i say
you have to explain the rest of it  what she hisses offering me a sharp glance
we had a deal i keep you alive you find evelyns murderer  the plague doctor has to hear it from you i say
he wont let you go otherwise
trust me you have all the pieces you just need to put them together
here take this  reaching into my pocket i hand her the piece of paper
unfolding it she reads it aloud
all of them she says wrinkling her forehead
what does that mean  its the answer to a question i had cunningham ask mrs drudge  what question  were any of the other hardcastle children charlie carvers
i wanted to know who hed give his life for  but theyre all dead now  the mysterious lantern bobs in the air coming closer and closer
the person holding it is hurrying making no attempt at stealth
the time for subterfuge has passed
who is that asks anna shielding her eyes and squinting at the approaching light
yes who am i says madeline aubert lowering the lantern to reveal the gun pointed directly at us
shes discarded her maids uniform in favour of trousers and a loose linen shirt a beige cardigan thrown over her shoulders
her dark hairs wet her pockmarked skin thick with powder
the mask of servitude removed she has the look of her mother the same oval eyes and freckles swirling into a milky white complexion
i can only hope anna sees it
anna looks from me to madeline and back again confusion giving way to panic on her face
aiden help me she pleads
it has to be you i say searching out her cold hand in the darkness
all the pieces are in front of you
who was in a position to kill thomas hardcastle and lady hardcastle in exactly the same way nineteen years apart
why did evelyn say “im not” and “millicent murder” after i saved her
why did she have a signet ring shed given to felicity maddox
what did millicent derby know that got her killed
why was gregory gold hired to paint new portraits of the family when the rest of the house was crumbling
who would helena hardcastle and charlie carver have lied to protect  clarity arrives on annas face like a sunrise her eyes widening as she looks from the note to madelines expectant expression
evelyn hardcastle she says quietly
then louder youre evelyn hardcastle      59   quite what reaction id expected from evelyn im not sure but she surprises me by clapping her hands in delight jumping up and down as though were pets performing a new trick
i knew it would be worth following you two she says placing her lantern on the ground stitching its glow to ours
people dont trek all the way into the darkness without a little knowledge to light the way
though i must confess im at a loss as to how this is any of your concern  shes shed her french accent and with it any trace of the dutiful maid she was hiding behind
shoulders that once slouched straighten immediately her neck stiffening pushing her chin into the air so that she seems to survey us from atop some lofty cliff
her questioning gaze passes between us but my attention is fixed on the forest
this will all be for nothing if the plague doctor isnt here to hear it but beyond the puddle of light cast by our two lanterns its pitchblack
he could be standing ten yards away and id never know
mistaking my silence for obstinacy evelyn offers me a wide smile
shes enjoying us
shes going to savour us
we have to keep her entertained until the plague doctor arrives
this was what you had planned for thomas all those years ago wasnt it i say pointing towards helenas body in the boathouse
i questioned the stablemaster who told me youd gone out riding on the morning of his death but that was just an alibi
youd arranged to meet thomas here so all you had to do was ride past the gatehouse tie up the horse and cut directly through the forest
i timed it myself
you could have arrived in under half an hour without anybody seeing giving you plenty of time to murder thomas quietly in the boathouse wash in the water change clothes and be back on your horse before anybody knew he was missing
youd stolen the murder weapon from the stablemaster and the blanket you were going to cover the body in
he was supposed to take the blame once thomas was found only the plan went wrong didnt it  everything went wrong she says clicking her tongue
the boathouse was a backup in case my first idea went awry
i intended to daze thomas with a rock and then drown him leaving him floating in the lake for somebody to find
a tragic accident and wed all go about our lives
sadly i didnt get a chance to use either plan
i hit thomas over the head but not nearly hard enough
he started screaming and i panicked stabbing him out here in the open  she sounds irritated though not unduly so
its as though shes describing nothing more serious than a picnic spoiled by bad weather and i catch myself staring at her
id deduced most of the story before coming here but to hear it relayed so callously without regret of any sort is horrifying
shes soulless conscienceless
i can barely believe shes a person
noticing me floundering anna takes up the conversation
and thats when lady hardcastle and charlie carver stumbled upon you shes considering every word laying them ahead of her onrushing thoughts
somehow you managed to convince them thomass death was an accident  they did most of the work themselves muses evelyn
i thought it was all over when they appeared on that path
i got halfway through telling them i was trying to get the knife away from thomas when carver filled in the rest for me
accident children playing that sort of thing
he handed me a story giftwrapped  did you know carver was your father i ask regaining my composure
no but i was a child
i simply accepted my good fortune and went riding as i was told
it wasnt until id been shipped off to paris that mother told me the truth
i think she wanted me to be proud of him  so carver sees his daughter covered in blood on the lake bank continues anna speaking slowly trying to put everything in order
he realises youre going to need some clean clothes and he goes to the house to fetch them while helena stays with thomas
thats what stanwin saw when he followed carver to the lake thats why he believed helena killed her own son
its why he let his friend take the blame  that and a great deal of money says evelyn her lip curling revealing the tips of her teeth
her green eyes are glassy blank
utterly without empathy intolerant of remorse
mother paid him handsomely over the years  charlie carver didnt know youd planned the murder beforehand and already had a change of clothes waiting in the boathouse i say struggling not to look for the plague doctor among the trees
the clothes stayed there hidden for eighteen years until your mother found them when she visited blackheath last year
she knew what they meant immediately
she even told michael about them probably to test his reaction  she must have thought he knew about the murder says anna pityingly
can you imagine she couldnt trust either of her children  a breeze is stirring rain plinking against our lanterns
theres a noise from the forest indistinct and distant but enough to draw evelyns attention for an instant
stall her i mouth to anna as i remove my coat and lay it across her thin shoulders earning a grateful smile
it must have been terrible for lady hardcastle says anna drawing the coat tighter
realising the daughter she let her lover go to the gallows to protect had murdered her own brother in cold blood her voice drops
how could you do that evelyn  i think the better question is why she did it i say looking at anna
thomas liked to follow people around
he knew hed get into trouble if he was caught so he got very good at being quiet
one day he followed evelyn into the forest where she met a stable boy
i dont know why they were meeting or even if it had been planned
maybe it was a coincidence but i think there was an accident
i hope it was an accident i say shooting a glance at evelyn whos appraising me like a moth thats landed on her jacket
our entire futures written in the creases around her eyes that pale white face is a crystal ball with only horrors in the fog
doesnt matter really i carry on realising she isnt going to answer me
either way she killed him
likely thomas didnt understand what hed seen or hed have run back and told his mother but at some point evelyn realised he knew
she had two choices silence thomas before he told somebody or confess to what shed done
she chose the first option and set about her work methodically  thats very good says evelyn her face lighting up
aside from a detail or two its almost as if you were there in the flesh
youre a delight mr gold you know that
far more entertaining than the dull creature i mistook you for last night  what happened to the stable boy asks anna
the stablemaster said he was never found  evelyn considers her for a long while
at first i think its because shes deciding whether to answer the question and then i realise the truth
shes summoning the memory
she hasnt thought about it in years
it was the most curious thing says evelyn distantly
he took me to see some caves hed found
i knew my parents wouldnt approve so we went in secret but he was very tedious company
we were exploring and he fell into a deep hole
nothing too serious i could easily have fetched help
i told him i was going to and then it dawned on me
i didnt have to fetch help
i didnt have to do anything at all
i could leave him there
nobody knew where hed gone or that i was with him
it seemed like fate  you just abandoned him says anna aghast
and you know i rather enjoyed it
he was my thrilling little secret until thomas asked me why id gone to the caves that day keeping her gun trained on us she lifts her lantern out of the mud
and the rest you know
pity really  she cocks the hammer but anna steps in front of me
wait she says stretching out a hand
please dont beg says evelyn exasperated
i hold you in such high regard really you have no idea
aside from my mother nobodys thought twice about thomass death in nearly twenty years and then out of the blue you two appear with almost the entire thing wrapped up in a nice little bow
it must have taken a great deal of determination and i admire that but nothing is so unbecoming as a lack of pride  im not going to beg but the storys not done says anna
we deserve to hear the rest of it  evelyn smiles her expression beautiful and brittle and utterly mad
you think me a fool she says wiping the rain from her eyes
i think youre going to kill us says anna calmly speaking as one would to a small child
and i think if you do it out in the open lots of people will hear
you need to move us somewhere quieter so why not let us talk on the way  evelyn takes a few steps towards her holding the lantern close to her face so that she might better inspect her
her head is cocked lips slightly parted
clever girl says evelyn purring in admiration
very well turn around and start walking  i listen to this exchange with increasing panic desperately hoping the plague doctor will appear out of the gloom and finally put an end to this
he must surely have enough evidence to support annas freedom by now
unless hes been delayed
the thought fills me with dread
annas trying to keep us alive but it will all be for nothing if the plague doctor doesnt know where to find us
i reach for our lantern but evelyn kicks it away motioning us into the forest with the point of her gun
we walk side by side with evelyn a couple of paces behind humming softly
i risk a look over my shoulder but shes far enough back to make snatching the gun an impossible endeavour
even if i could it wouldnt be any use
were not here to capture evelyn were here to prove annas not like her and the best way of doing that is to be in danger
heavy clouds blot out the stars and with only evelyns dim flame to guide us were having to move cautiously to avoid tripping
its like trying to navigate through ink and still theres no sign of the plague doctor
if your mother knew a year ago what youd done why didnt she tell everybody then asks anna glancing back at evelyn
why arrange this party why invite all these people  theres genuine curiosity in her tone
if shes afraid shes keeping it in a pocket somewhere i cant see
evidently evelyns not the only actress in the house
i can only hope im doing as well
my hearts thumping hard enough to crack a rib
greed says evelyn
my parents needed money more than my mother needed to see me hang
i can only assume the marriage took some time to arrange because mother sent me a letter last month telling me that unless i allowed myself to be wedded to that odious ravencourt theyd turn me in
the humiliation of todays party was a parting shot a slither of justice for thomas  so you killed them in revenge asks anna
father was a trade
michael murdered felicity and i murdered father
my brother wanted his inheritance while there still was one
hes buying stanwins blackmail business with coleridge  then it really was your boot print i saw outside the gatehouse window i say
and you left the note claiming responsibility  well i couldnt have poor michael being blamed that would defeat the point entirely she says
i dont intend on using my name once i leave here so why not put it to some use  and your mother asks anna
why kill her  i was in paris says evelyn anger heating her words for the first time
if she hadnt bartered me to ravencourt shed never have seen me again
as far as im concerned she committed suicide  the trees break suddenly revealing the gatehouse
weve come out around the back of the building opposite the latched door into the kitchen the fake evelyn showed bell that first morning
where did you find the other evelyn i ask
her name was felicity maddox
she was some sort of con artist from what i understand says evelyn vaguely
stanwin arranged everything
michael told him the family wanted felicity to marry ravencourt in my place at which point theyd pay him half of the dowry to keep quiet  did stanwin know what you planned to do asks anna
perhaps but why would he care shrugs evelyn gesturing for me to open the door
felicity was an insect
some policeman or other tried to help her this afternoon and you know what she did
instead of admitting everything to him she ran straight to michael and asked for more money to keep quiet
really a person like that is a stain upon the world
i consider her murder an act of public service  and millicent derby was her death a public service  oh millicent says evelyn brightening at the memory
you know back in the day she was as bad as her son
she just didnt have the energy for it in her later years  were passing through the kitchen into the hallway
the house is silent all of its occupants dead
despite that a lamp burns brightly on the wall suggesting evelyn always intended on coming back here
millicent recognised you didnt she i say dragging my fingertips along the wallpaper
i can feel myself coming unstuck
none of this feels real any more
i need to touch something solid so i know im not dreaming
she spotted you in the ballroom alongside felicity i continue remembering how the old lady hurried away from derby
she had watched you grow up and wasnt going to be fooled by a maids outfit and golds new portraits on the wall
millicent knew immediately who you were  she came down to the kitchen demanding to know what i was up to says evelyn
i told her it was a prank for the ball and the silly old dear believed me  i glance around hoping for some hint of the plague doctors presence but my hope is fading
theres no reason for him to know were here so he will have no idea how courageous annas being or that shes solved his riddle
were wading towards death with a madwoman and its all for nothing
how did you kill her i ask desperately trying to keep evelyn talking while i come up with a new plan
i stole a bottle of veronal from doctor dickies bag and crushed a few tablets into her tea she says
when she passed out i held a pillow over her face until she stopped breathing and then fetched dickie  theres joy in her voice as if this is some happy old memory being shared among friends at the dinner table
he saw the veronal from his bag on her nightstand and immediately realised he was implicated she says
thats the beauty of corrupt men you can always rely on them to be corrupt  so he took the bottle away and claimed it was a heart attack to cover his own tracks i say letting out a little sigh
oh dont fret lover she says prodding me in the back with the barrel of the gun
millicent derby died as she lived with elegance and calculation
it was a gift believe me
we should all be so lucky to meet such a meaningful end  i worry shes leading us into the room where lord hardcastle sits twisted in his chair but instead she shepherds us through the door opposite
its a small dining room four chairs and a square table at its centre
evelyns lantern light scatters across the walls illuminating two canvas bags in the corner each of them stuffed to bursting with jewellery clothing and whatever else she could steal from blackheath
her new life will begin where ours ends
ever the artist gold can at least appreciate the symmetry
placing her lantern on the table evelyn gestures for us to kneel on the floor
her eyes are glittering her face flushed
a window faces the road but i can see no sign of the plague doctor
im afraid youre out of time she says raising the gun
one move left to play
why did you kill michael i ask quickly hurling the accusation at her
evelyn tenses her smile evaporating
what are you talking about  you poisoned him i say watching the confusion sketch itself on her face
every day all ive heard is how close you two were how much you loved him
he didnt even know that youd killed thomas or your mother did he
you didnt want him thinking ill of you
and yet when the time came you killed him as easily as the rest of your victims  her gaze is flicking between myself and anna the gun wavering in her hand
for the first time she seems afraid
youre lying id never hurt michael she says
i watched him die evelyn i say
i stood over him as  she strikes me with the gun blood oozing from my lip
id intended on snatching the gun from her but she was too fast and shes already taken a step away from us
dont lie to me she wails eyes ablaze rapid breaths escaping her mouth
hes not protests anna wrapping her arms around my shoulders protectively
tears roll down evelyns cheeks her lip trembling
her love is rabid pulsing and rotten but its sincere
somehow that only makes her more monstrous
i didnt shes clutching her hair pulling hard enough to tear it from the roots
he knew i couldnt marry he wanted to help she looks at us pleadingly
he killed her for me so i could be free he loved me  you had to be certain though i say
you couldnt risk him losing his nerve and felicity waking up again so you gave her a glass of poisoned scotch before she walked out to the reflecting pool  but you didnt tell michael anna continues
and he drank what was left while rashton was questioning him  evelyns gun has dipped and i tense readying myself to spring for it but anna tightens her grip around me
hes here she whispers into my ear nodding towards the window
a single candle burns on the road illuminating a porcelain beak mask
hope stirs but withers immediately
he isnt moving
he cant even hear whats being said
whats he waiting for
oh no says anna sounding sick to her stomach
shes staring at the plague doctor as well except instead of my confusion theres horror
shes gone pale her fingers clutching at my sleeve
we havent solved it she says speaking under her breath
we still dont know who kills evelyn hardcastle the real evelyn hardcastle
and our suspect pool is down to two  a cold weight settles on me
id hoped annas unmasking of evelyn would be enough to earn her freedom but shes right
for all the plague doctors talk of redemption and rehabilitation he still needs one more life to pay the piper and he expects one of us to deliver it
evelyns still pacing still tearing at her hair still distracted by michaels death but shes too far away to ambush
maybe anna or i could wrestle the gun from her hand but not before the other one was shot dead
weve been tricked
the plague doctor stayed away on purpose so he wouldnt have to hear annas answer and confront the good woman shes become
he doesnt know i was wrong about michael
or he doesnt care
hes got what he wanted
if i die hell free me
if she dies shes trapped here just like his superiors wanted
theyre going to keep her forever no matter what she does
unable to hold in my despair in any longer i run to the window and bang on the glass
its not fair i scream at the distant shape of the plague doctor
my fury startles anna who jumps away in fright
evelyn advances on me with her gun raised mistaking my anger for panic
desperation claws at me
i told the plague doctor i wouldnt abandon anna that id find a way back into blackheath if they released me but i cant spend another day in this place
i cant let myself be slaughtered again
i cant watch felicitys suicide or be betrayed by daniel coleridge
i cant live any of this over and part of me a much larger part than id ever have believed possible is ready to rush evelyn and be done with it all regardless of what happens to my friend
blinded by my misery i dont notice anna come to me
ignoring evelyn whos watching her the way an owl might a dancing mouse anna takes both my hands and stands on her tiptoes kissing me on the cheek
dont you dare come back for me she says pressing her forehead to mine
she acts fast turning on her heel and leaping at evelyn in one fluid motion
the gunshot is deafening and for a few seconds its fading echo is all there is
crying out i rush to annas side even as the gun clatters to the floor blood seeping through evelyns shirt above her hip
her mouth opens and closes as she drops to her knees a silent plea held in those hollow eyes
felicity maddox is standing in the doorway a nightmare come to life
shes still wearing her blue ball gown now dripping wet and covered in mud her makeup running down pale cheeks scratched by her hurried flight through the trees
her lipstick is smeared her hair wild the black revolver steady in her hand
she throws us a quick glance but i doubt she sees us
rage has left her half mad
pointing the revolver at evelyns stomach she pulls the trigger the shot so loud i have to cover my ears as blood splashes across the wallpaper
not satisfied she fires again evelyn collapsing on the floor
walking over to her felicity empties the last of her bullets into evelyns lifeless body
60   annas face is pressed against my chest but i cant look away from felicity
i dont know if this is justice or not but im desperately grateful for it all the same
annas sacrifice would have set me free but the guilt would never have let me go
her death would have made me a stranger to myself
felicity saved me
her revolvers empty but shes still pressing the trigger burying evelyn in a chorus of hollow clicks
i think she would go on forever but shes interrupted by the plague doctors arrival
he gently takes the weapon from her hand and as if a spells been broken her eyes clear life coming into her limbs
she looks bonetired and emptied out pushed beyond thought
with a last lingering look at evelyns body she nods to the plague doctor before brushing by him and disappearing outside not even a lantern to guide her way
a moment later the front door opens the sound of pounding rain filling the air
i let anna go and slump onto the carpet holding my head in my hands
you told felicity we were here didnt you i say through my fingers
it comes out as an accusation though im certain id meant to signal my gratitude
at this point with all thats happened perhaps theres no untangling the two
i gave her a choice he says kneeling down to close evelyns stillopen eyes
her nature took care of the rest as did yours  hes looking at anna as he says this but his gaze soon passes over her roaming the bloodsplattered walls before returning to the body lying at his feet
part of me wonders if he isnt admiring his own work the indirect ruin of a human being
how long have you known who the real evelyn was asks anna whos looking the plague doctor up and down examining him with a childs wonder
at precisely the same moment you did he says
i came to the lake as requested and witnessed her unmasking first hand
when it became apparent where she was leading you i returned to blackheath to relay the information to the actress  but why help us asks anna
justice he says simply the beak mask turning in her direction
evelyn deserved to die and felicity deserved to kill her
you two have proven that you deserve your freedom and i would not have you falter at the final hurdle  is this it are we really done i ask my voice trembling
almost he says
i still need anna to formally answer the question of who killed evelyn hardcastle  and what about aiden she asks placing a hand on my shoulder
he blamed michael  mr bishop solved the murders of michael peter and helena hardcastle and the attempted murder of felicity maddox a crime so cleverly concealed it was entirely unknown to myself and my superiors says the plague doctor
i cannot fault him for answering questions we never thought to ask nor will i punish a man who risked so much to save somebody elses life
his answer stands
now i need yours
who killed evelyn hardcastle anna  you didnt say anything about aidens other hosts she says stubbornly
will you let them go as well
some of them are still alive
if we go now we can probably still save the butler
and what about poor sebastian bell
he only woke up this morning
what will he do without me to help him  aiden is the sebastian bell who woke up this morning says the plague doctor kindly
they were never anything more than a trick of the light anna
shadows cast on a wall
now you get to walk away with the flame that casts them and once that happens theyll vanish  she blinks at him
trust me anna he says
tell me who killed evelyn hardcastle and everybody is freed
one way or another  aiden  she glances at me uncertainly waiting for my approval
i can only nod
a flood of emotion is welling up inside of me waiting for release
felicity maddox she declares
youre free he says standing up
blackheath wont cling to either of you any longer  my shoulders are shaking
unable to hold it in i begin sobbing wretchedly eight days of misery and fear pouring out like poison
anna takes hold of me but i cant stop
im on the edge of my nerves relieved and exhausted terrified were being tricked
everything else in blackheath was a lie why not this as well
i stare at evelyns body and see michael thrashing in the sun room and stanwins baffled expression when daniel shot him in the forest
peter and helena jonathan and millicent dance davies rashton
the footman and coleridge
the dead piled up
how does somebody escape all this
by saying a name  anna i mutter
im here she says clutching me fiercely
were going home aiden
you did it you kept your promise  she gazes at me not a drop of doubt anywhere in her eyes
shes smiling jubilant
one day and one life i thought it wouldnt be enough to escape this place but perhaps its the only way to escape this place
keeping tight hold of me she looks up at the plague doctor
what happens next she asks
i still cant remember anything before this morning  you will says the plague doctor
youve served your sentence so all possessions will be returned to you including your memories
if you wish
most choose to leave them behind and go on as they are
it may be something worth considering  anna digests this and i realise she still doesnt know who she is or what she did
thats going to be a difficult conversation but its not one i have the strength to face right now
i need to pack blackheath away deep in the dark where my nightmares live and im not going to be free of it for a very long time
if i can spare anna similar suffering even for a little while i will
you should go says the plague doctor
i think youve lingered here long enough  are you ready asks anna
i am i say letting her help me to my feet
thank you for everything she says to the plague doctor curtsying before leaving the house
he watches her depart then hands me evelyns lantern
theyll be looking for her aiden he whispers
dont trust anybody and dont let yourselves remember
at best the memories will cripple you at worst he lets that hang
once youre released start running and dont stop
thats your only chance  whats going to happen to you i ask
i doubt your superiors will be happy when they find out what youve done  oh theyll be furious he says cheerfully
but today feels like a good day and blackheath hasnt seen one of those for a very long time
i think ill enjoy it for a while and worry about the cost tomorrow
it will come soon enough it always does  he holds out his hand
good luck aiden  you too i say shaking it and passing outside into the storm
annas waiting on the road her eyes fixed on blackheath
she looks so young so carefree but its a mask
theres another face beneath this one a woman hated by half the world and ive helped free her
uncertainty flickers within me but whatever shes done whatevers waiting well overcome it together
here and now thats all that matters to me
where should we go asks anna as i sweep the dark forest with the lanterns warm light
i dont know i say
i dont think it matters  she takes my hand squeezing it gently
then lets start walking and see where we end up  and so we do one foot in front of the other pressing into the darkness with only the dimmest of lights for guidance
i try to picture whats waiting for me
the family i abandoned
grandchildren raised on stories of what i did
or just another forest another house mired in secrets
i hope not
i hope my world is something else entirely
something unknown and unfathomable something i cant even imagine from inside the confines of golds mind
after all its not only blackheath im escaping
its them
its bell and the butler davies ravencourt dance and derby
its rashton and gold
blackheath was the prison but they were the shackles
and the keys
i owe my freedom to every single one of them
and what of aiden bishop
what do i owe him
the man who trapped me here so he could torture annabelle caulker
i wont give him his memories back im certain of that
tomorrow ill see his face in the mirror and somehow ill have to make it mine
to do that i need to start again free of the past free of him and the mistakes he made
free of his voice
thank you i say under my breath feeling him finally drift away
it seems like a dream too much to hope for
tomorrow therell be no footman to overcome
no evelyn hardcastle to save or daniel coleridge to outwit
no ticking clock hanging over a puzzlebox house
instead of the impossible ill need only concern myself with the ordinary
the luxury of waking up in the same bed two days in a row or being able to reach the next village should i choose
the luxury of sunshine
the luxury of honesty
the luxury of living a life without a murder at the end of it
tomorrow can be whatever i want it to be which means for the first time in decades i can look forward to it
instead of being something to fear it can be a promise i make myself
a chance to be braver or kinder to make what was wrong right
to be better than i am today
every day after this one is a gift
i just have to keep walking until i get there
