chapter i
the man who died   i returned from the city about three oclock on that may afternoon pretty well disgusted with life
i had been three months in the old country and was fed up with it
if anyone had told me a year ago that i would have been feeling like that i should have laughed at him but there was the fact
the weather made me liverish the talk of the ordinary englishman made me sick
i couldnt get enough exercise and the amusements of london seemed as flat as sodawater that has been standing in the sun
richard hannay i kept telling myself you have got into the wrong ditch my friend and you had better climb out  it made me bite my lips to think of the plans i had been building up those last years in buluwayo
i had got my pilenot one of the big ones but good enough for me and i had figured out all kinds of ways of enjoying myself
my father had brought me out from scotland at the age of six and i had never been home since so england was a sort of arabian nights to me and i counted on stopping there for the rest of my days
but from the first i was disappointed with it
in about a week i was tired of seeing sights and in less than a month i had had enough of restaurants and theatres and racemeetings
i had no real pal to go about with which probably explains things
plenty of people invited me to their houses but they didnt seem much interested in me
they would fling me a question or two about south africa and then get on to their own affairs
a lot of imperialist ladies asked me to tea to meet schoolmasters from new zealand and editors from vancouver and that was the dismalest business of all
here was i thirtyseven years old sound in wind and limb with enough money to have a good time yawning my head off all day
i had just about settled to clear out and get back to the veld for i was the best bored man in the united kingdom
that afternoon i had been worrying my brokers about investments to give my mind something to work on and on my way home i turned into my clubrather a pothouse which took in colonial members
i had a long drink and read the evening papers
they were full of the row in the near east and there was an article about karolides the greek premier
i rather fancied the chap
from all accounts he seemed the one big man in the show and he played a straight game too which was more than could be said for most of them
i gathered that they hated him pretty blackly in berlin and vienna but that we were going to stick by him and one paper said that he was the only barrier between europe and armageddon
i remember wondering if i could get a job in those parts
it struck me that albania was the sort of place that might keep a man from yawning
about six oclock i went home dressed dined at the café royal and turned into a musichall
it was a silly show all capering women and monkeyfaced men and i did not stay long
the night was fine and clear as i walked back to the flat i had hired near portland place
the crowd surged past me on the pavements busy and chattering and i envied the people for having something to do
these shopgirls and clerks and dandies and policemen had some interest in life that kept them going
i gave halfacrown to a beggar because i saw him yawn he was a fellowsufferer
at oxford circus i looked up into the spring sky and i made a vow
i would give the old country another day to fit me into something if nothing happened i would take the next boat for the cape
my flat was the first floor in a new block behind langham place
there was a common staircase with a porter and a liftman at the entrance but there was no restaurant or anything of that sort and each flat was quite shut off from the others
i hate servants on the premises so i had a fellow to look after me who came in by the day
he arrived before eight oclock every morning and used to depart at seven for i never dined at home
i was just fitting my key into the door when i noticed a man at my elbow
i had not seen him approach and the sudden appearance made me start
he was a slim man with a short brown beard and small gimlety blue eyes
i recognized him as the occupant of a flat on the top floor with whom i had passed the time of day on the stairs
can i speak to you he said
may i come in for a minute he was steadying his voice with an effort and his hand was pawing my arm
i got my door open and motioned him in
no sooner was he over the threshold than he made a dash for my back room where i used to smoke and write my letters
then he bolted back
is the door locked he asked feverishly and he fastened the chain with his own hand
im very sorry he said humbly
its a mighty liberty but you looked the kind of man who would understand
ive had you in my mind all this week when things got troublesome
say will you do me a good turn  ill listen to you i said
thats all ill promise i was getting worried by the antics of this nervous little chap
there was a tray of drinks on a table beside him from which he filled himself a stiff whiskyandsoda
he drank it off in three gulps and cracked the glass as he set it down
pardon he said im a bit rattled tonight
you see i happen at this moment to be dead  i sat down in an armchair and lit my pipe
what does it feel like i asked
i was pretty certain that i had to deal with a madman
a smile flickered over his drawn face
im not madyet
say sir ive been watching you and i reckon youre a cool customer
i reckon too youre an honest man and not afraid of playing a bold hand
im going to confide in you
i need help worse than any man ever needed it and i want to know if i can count you in  get on with your yarn i said and ill tell you  he seemed to brace himself for a great effort and then started on the queerest rigmarole
i didnt get hold of it at first and i had to stop and ask him questions
but here is the gist of it  he was an american from kentucky and after college being pretty well off he had started out to see the world
he wrote a bit and acted as war correspondent for a chicago paper and spent a year or two in southeastern europe
i gathered that he was a fine linguist and had got to know pretty well the society in those parts
he spoke familiarly of many names that i remembered to have seen in the newspapers
he had played about with politics he told me at first for the interest of them and then because he couldnt help himself
i read him as a sharp restless fellow who always wanted to get down to the roots of things
he got a little further down than he wanted
i am giving you what he told me as well as i could make it out
away behind all the governments and the armies there was a big subterranean movement going on engineered by very dangerous people
he had come on it by accident it fascinated him he went further and then he got caught
i gathered that most of the people in it were the sort of educated anarchists that make revolutions but that beside them there were financiers who were playing for money
a clever man can make big profits on a falling market and it suited the book of both classes to set europe by the ears
he told me some queer things that explained a lot that had puzzled methings that happened in the balkan war how one state suddenly came out on top why alliances were made and broken why certain men disappeared and where the sinews of war came from
the aim of the whole conspiracy was to get russia and germany at loggerheads
when i asked why he said that the anarchist lot thought it would give them their chance
everything would be in the meltingpot and they looked to see a new world emerge
the capitalists would rake in the shekels and make fortunes by buying up wreckage
capital he said had no conscience and no fatherland
besides the jew was behind it and the jew hated russia worse than hell
do you wonder he cried
for three hundred years they have been persecuted and this is the return match for the pogroms
the jew is everywhere but you have to go far down the backstairs to find him
take any big teutonic business concern
if you have dealings with it the first man you meet is prince von und zu something an elegant young man who talks etonandharrow english
but he cuts no ice
if your business is big you get behind him and find a prognathous westphalian with a retreating brow and the manners of a hog
he is the german business man that gives your english papers the shakes
but if youre on the biggest kind of job and are bound to get to the real boss ten to one you are brought up against a little whitefaced jew in a bathchair with an eye like a rattlesnake
yes sir he is the man who is ruling the world just now and he has his knife in the empire of the tsar because his aunt was outraged and his father flogged in some onehorse location on the volga  i could not help saying that his jewanarchists seemed to have got left behind a little
yes and no he said
they won up to a point but they struck a bigger thing than money a thing that couldnt be bought the old elemental fighting instincts of man
if youre going to be killed you invent some kind of flag and country to fight for and if you survive you get to love the thing
those foolish devils of soldiers have found something they care for and that has upset the pretty plan laid in berlin and vienna
but my friends havent played their last card by a long sight
theyve gotten the ace up their sleeves and unless i can keep alive for a month they are going to play it and win  but i thought you were dead i put in
mors janua vitæ he smiled
i recognized the quotation it was about all the latin i knew
im coming to that but ive got to put you wise about a lot of things first
if you read your newspaper i guess you know the name of constantine karolides  i sat up at that for i had been reading about him that very afternoon
he is the man that has wrecked all their games
he is the one big brain in the whole show and he happens also to be an honest man
therefore he has been marked down these twelve months past
i found that outnot that it was difficult for any fool could guess as much
but i found out the way they were going to get him and that knowledge was deadly
thats why i have had to decease  he had another drink and i mixed it for him myself for i was getting interested in the beggar
they cant get him in his own land for he has a bodyguard of epirotes that would skin their grandmothers
but on the 15th day of june he is coming to this city
the british foreign office has taken to having international teaparties and the biggest of them is due on that date
now karolides is reckoned the principal guest and if my friends have their way he will never return to his admiring countrymen  thats simple enough anyhow i said
you can warn him and keep him at home  and play their game he asked sharply
if he does not come they win for hes the only man that can straighten out the tangle
and if his government are warned he wont come for he does not know how big the stakes will be on june the 15th  what about the british government i said
theyre not going to let their guests be murdered
tip them the wink and theyll take extra precautions  no good
they might stuff your city with plainclothes detectives and double the police and constantine would still be a doomed man
my friends are not playing this game for candy
they want a big occasion for the taking off with the eyes of all europe on it
hell be murdered by an austrian and therell be plenty of evidence to show the connivance of the big folk in vienna and berlin
it will all be an infernal lie of course but the case will look black enough to the world
im not talking hot air my friend
i happen to know every detail of the hellish contrivance and i can tell you it will be the most finished piece of blackguardism since the borgias
but its not going to come off if theres a certain man who knows the wheels of the business alive right here in london on the 15th day of june
and that man is going to be your servant franklin p scudder  i was getting to like the little chap
his jaw had shut like a rattrap and there was the fire of battle in his gimlety eyes
if he was spinning me a yarn he could act up to it
where did you find out this story i asked
i got the first hint in an inn on the achensee in tyrol
that set me inquiring and i collected my other clues in a furshop in the galician quarter of buda in a strangers club in vienna and in a little bookshop off the racknitzstrasse in leipsig
i completed my evidence ten days ago in paris
i cant tell you the details now for its something of a history
when i was quite sure in my own mind i judged it my business to disappear and i reached this city by a mighty queer circuit
i left paris a dandified young frenchamerican and i sailed from hamburg a jew diamond merchant
in norway i was an english student of ibsen collecting materials for lectures but when i left bergen i was a cinemaman with special ski films
and i came here from leith with a lot of pulpwood propositions in my pocket to put before the london newspapers
till yesterday i thought i had muddied my trail some and was feeling pretty happy
then  the recollection seemed to upset him and he gulped down some more whisky
then i saw a man standing in the street outside this block
i used to stay close in my room all day and only slip out after dark for an hour or two
i watched him for a bit from my window and i thought i recognized him
he came in and spoke to the porter
when i came back from my walk last night i found a card in my letterbox
it bore the name of the man i want least to meet on gods earth  i think that the look in my companions eyes the sheer naked scare on his face completed my conviction of his honesty
my own voice sharpened a bit as i asked him what he did next
i realized that i was bottled as sure as a pickled herring and that there was only one way out
i had to die
if my pursuers knew i was dead they would go to sleep again  how did you manage it  i told the man that valets me that i was feeling pretty bad and i got myself up to look like death
that wasnt difficult for im no slouch at disguises
then i got a corpseyou can always get a body in london if you know where to go for it
i fetched it back in a trunk on the top of a fourwheeler and i had to be assisted upstairs to my room
you see i had to pile up some evidence for the inquest
i went to bed and got my man to mix me a sleepingdraught and then told him to clear out
he wanted to fetch a doctor but i swore some and said i couldnt abide leeches
when i was left alone i started in to fake up that corpse
he was my size and i judged had perished from too much alcohol so i put some spirits handy about the place
the jaw was the weak point in the likeness so i blew it away with a revolver
i daresay there will be somebody tomorrow to swear to having heard a shot but there are no neighbours on my floor and i guessed i could risk it
so i left the body in bed dressed up in my pyjamas with a revolver lying on the bedclothes and a considerable mess around
then i got into a suit of clothes i had kept waiting for emergencies
i didnt dare to shave for fear of leaving tracks and besides it wasnt any kind of use my trying to get into the streets
i had had you in my mind all day and there seemed nothing to do but to make an appeal to you
i watched from my window till i saw you come home and then slipped down the stair to meet you
there sir i guess you know about as much as me of this business  he sat blinking like an owl fluttering with nerves and yet desperately determined
by this time i was pretty well convinced that he was going straight with me
it was the wildest sort of narrative but i had heard in my time many steep tales which had turned out to be true and i had made a practice of judging the man rather than the story
if he had wanted to get a location in my flat and then cut my throat he would have pitched a milder yarn
hand me your key i said and ill take a look at the corpse
excuse my caution but im bound to verify a bit if i can  he shook his head mournfully
i reckoned youd ask for that but i havent got it
its on my chain on the dressingtable
i had to leave it behind for i couldnt leave any clues to breed suspicions
the gentry who are after me are pretty brighteyed citizens
youll have to take me on trust for the night and tomorrow youll get proof of the corpse business right enough  i thought for an instant or two
right
ill trust you for the night
ill lock you into this room and keep the key
just one word mr scudder
i believe youre straight but if so be you are not i should warn you that im a handy man with a gun  sure he said jumping up with some briskness
i havent the privilege of your name sir but let me tell you that youre a white man
ill thank you to lend me a razor  i took him into my bedroom and turned him loose
in half an hours time a figure came out that i scarcely recognized
only his gimlety hungry eyes were the same
he was shaved clean his hair was parted in the middle and he had cut his eyebrows
further he carried himself as if he had been drilled and was the very model even to the brown complexion of some british officer who had had a long spell in india
he had a monocle too which he stuck in his eye and every trace of the american had gone out of his speech
my hat
mr scudder i stammered
not mr scudder he corrected captain theophilus digby of the 40th gurkhas presently home on leave
ill thank you to remember that sir  i made him up a bed in my smokingroom and sought my own couch more cheerful than i had been for the past month
things did happen occasionally even in this godforgotten metropolis
i woke next morning to hear my man paddock making the deuce of a row at the smokingroom door
paddock was a fellow i had done a good turn to out on the selakwe and i had inspanned him as my servant as soon as i got to england
he had about as much gift of the gab as a hippopotamus and was not a great hand at valeting but i knew i could count on his loyalty
stop that row paddock i said
theres a friend of mine captaincaptain i couldnt remember the name dossing down in there
get breakfast for two and then come and speak to me  i told paddock a fine story about how my friend was a great swell with his nerves pretty bad from overwork who wanted absolute rest and stillness
nobody had got to know he was here or he would be besieged by communications from the india office and the prime minister and his cure would be ruined
i am bound to say scudder played up splendidly when he came to breakfast
he fixed paddock with his eyeglass just like a british officer asked him about the boer war and slung out at me a lot of stuff about imaginary pals
paddock couldnt learn to call me sir but he sirred scudder as if his life depended on it
i left him with the newspaper and a box of cigars and went down to the city till luncheon
when i got back the liftman had an important face
nawsty business ere this morning sir
gent in no
15 been and shot isself
theyve just took im to the mortiary
the police are up there now  i ascended to no
15 and found a couple of bobbies and an inspector busy making an examination
i asked a few idiotic questions and they soon kicked me out
then i found the man that had valeted scudder and pumped him but i could see he suspected nothing
he was a whining fellow with a churchyard face and halfacrown went far to console him
i attended the inquest next day
a partner of some publishing firm gave evidence that the deceased had brought him woodpulp propositions and had been he believed an agent of an american business
the jury found it a case of suicide while of unsound mind and the few effects were handed over to the american consul to deal with
i gave scudder a full account of the affair and it interested him greatly
he said he wished he could have attended the inquest for he reckoned it would be about as spicy as to read ones own obituary notice
the first two days he stayed with me in that back room he was very peaceful
he read and smoked a bit and made a heap of jottings in a notebook and every night we had a game of chess at which he beat me hollow
i think he was nursing his nerves back to health for he had had a pretty trying time
but on the third day i could see he was beginning to get restless
he fixed up a list of the days till june 15th and ticked each off with a red pencil making remarks in shorthand against them
i would find him sunk in a brown study with his sharp eyes abstracted and after those spells of meditation he was apt to be very despondent
then i could see that he began to get edgy again
he listened for little noises and was always asking me if paddock could be trusted
once or twice he got very peevish and apologized for it
i didnt blame him
i made every allowance for he had taken on a fairly stiff job
it was not the safety of his own skin that troubled him but the success of the scheme he had planned
that little man was clean grit all through without a soft spot in him
one night he was very solemn
say hannay he said i judge i should let you a bit deeper into this business
i should hate to go out without leaving somebody else to put up a fight and he began to tell me in detail what i had only heard from him vaguely
i did not give him very close attention
the fact is i was more interested in his own adventures than in his high politics
i reckoned that karolides and his affairs were not my business leaving all that to him
so a lot that he said slipped clean out of my memory
i remember that he was very clear that the danger to karolides would not begin till he had got to london and would come from the very highest quarters where there would be no thought of suspicion
he mentioned the name of a womanjulia czechenyias having something to do with the danger
she would be the decoy i gathered to get karolides out of the care of his guards
he talked too about a black stone and a man that lisped in his speech and he described very particularly somebody that he never referred to without a shudderan old man with a young voice who could hood his eyes like a hawk
he spoke a good deal about death too
he was mortally anxious about winning through with his job but he didnt care a rush for his life
i reckon its like going to sleep when you are pretty well tired out and waking to find a summer day with the scent of hay coming in at the window
i used to thank god for such mornings way back in the bluegrass country and i guess ill thank him when i wake up on the other side of jordan  next day he was much more cheerful and read the life of stonewall jackson much of the time
i went out to dinner with a mining engineer i had got to see on business and came back about halfpast ten in time for our game of chess before turning in
i had a cigar in my mouth i remember as i pushed open the smokingroom door
the lights were not lit which struck me as odd
i wondered if scudder had turned in already
i snapped the switch but there was nobody there
then i saw something in the far corner which made me drop my cigar and fall into a cold sweat
my guest was lying sprawled on his back
there was a long knife through his heart which skewered him to the floor
chapter ii
the milkman sets out on his travels   i sat down in an armchair and felt very sick
that lasted for maybe five minutes and was succeeded by a fit of the horrors
the poor staring white face on the floor was more than i could bear and i managed to get a tablecloth and cover it
then i staggered to a cupboard found the brandy and swallowed several mouthfuls
i had seen men die violently before indeed i had killed a few myself in the matabele war but this coldblooded indoor business was different
still i managed to pull myself together
i looked at my watch and saw that it was halfpast ten
an idea seized me and i went over the flat with a smalltooth comb
there was nobody there nor any trace of anybody but i shuttered and bolted all the windows and put the chain on the door
by this time my wits were coming back to me and i could think again
it took me about an hour to figure the thing out and i did not hurry for unless the murderer came back i had till about six oclock in the morning for my cogitations
i was in the soupthat was pretty clear
any shadow of a doubt i might have had about the truth of scudders tale was now gone
the proof of it was lying under the tablecloth
the men who knew that he knew what he knew had found him and had taken the best way to make certain of his silence
yes but he had been in my rooms four days and his enemies must have reckoned that he had confided in me
so i would be the next to go
it might be that very night or next day or the day after but my number was up all right
then suddenly i thought of another probability
supposing i went out now and called in the police or went to bed and let paddock find the body and call them in the morning
what kind of a story was i to tell about scudder
i had lied to paddock about him and the whole thing looked desperately fishy
if i made a clean breast of it and told the police everything he had told me they would simply laugh at me
the odds were a thousand to one that i would be charged with the murder and the circumstantial evidence was strong enough to hang me
few people knew me in england i had no real pal who could come forward and swear to my character
perhaps that was what those secret enemies were playing for
they were clever enough for anything and an english prison was as good a way of getting rid of me till after june 15th as a knife in my chest
besides if i told the whole story and by any miracle was believed i would be playing their game
karolides would stay at home which was what they wanted
somehow or other the sight of scudders dead face had made me a passionate believer in his scheme
he was gone but he had taken me into his confidence and i was pretty well bound to carry on his work
you may think this ridiculous for a man in danger of his life but that was the way i looked at it
i am an ordinary sort of fellow not braver than other people but i hate to see a good man downed and that long knife would not be the end of scudder if i could play the game in his place
it took me an hour or two to think this out and by that time i had come to a decision
i must vanish somehow and keep vanished till the end of the second week in june
then i must somehow find a way to get in touch with the government people and tell them what scudder had told me
i wished to heaven he had told me more and that i had listened more carefully to the little he had told me
i knew nothing but the barest facts
there was a big risk that even if i weathered the other dangers i would not be believed in the end
i must take my chance of that and hope that something might happen which would confirm my tale in the eyes of the government
my first job was to keep going for the next three weeks
it was now the 24th day of may and that meant twenty days of hiding before i could venture to approach the powers that be
i reckoned that two sets of people would be looking for mescudders enemies to put me out of existence and the police who would want me for scudders murder
it was going to be a giddy hunt and it was queer how the prospect comforted me
i had been slack so long that almost any chance of activity was welcome
when i had to sit alone with that corpse and wait on fortune i was no better than a crushed worm but if my necks safety was to hang on my own wits i was prepared to be cheerful about it
my next thought was whether scudder had any papers about him to give me a better clue to the business
i drew back the tablecloth and searched his pockets for i had no longer any shrinking from the body
the face was wonderfully calm for a man who had been struck down in a moment
there was nothing in the breastpocket and only a few loose coins and a cigarholder in the waistcoat
the trousers held a little penknife and some silver and the side pocket of his jacket contained an old crocodileskin cigarcase
there was no sign of the little black book in which i had seen him making notes
that had no doubt been taken by his murderer
but as i looked up from my task i saw that some drawers had been pulled out in the writingtable
scudder would never have left them in that state for he was the tidiest of mortals
someone must have been searching for somethingperhaps for the pocketbook
i went round the flat and found that everything had been ransackedthe inside of books drawers cupboards boxes even the pockets of the clothes in my wardrobe and the sideboard in the diningroom
there was no trace of the book
most likely the enemy had found it but they had not found it on scudders body
then i got out an atlas and looked at a big map of the british isles
my notion was to get off to some wild district where my veldcraft would be of some use to me for i would be like a trapped rat in a city
i considered that scotland would be best for my people were scotch and i could pass anywhere as an ordinary scotsman
i had half an idea at first to be a german tourist for my father had had german partners and i had been brought up to speak the tongue pretty fluently not to mention having put in three years prospecting for copper in german damaraland
but i calculated that it would be less conspicuous to be a scot and less in a line with what the police might know of my past
i fixed on galloway as the best place to go
it was the nearest wild part of scotland so far as i could figure it out and from the look of the map was not over thick with population
a search in bradshaw informed me that a train left st pancras at 710 which would land me at any galloway station in the late afternoon
that was well enough but a more important matter was how i was to make my way to st pancras for i was pretty certain that scudders friends would be watching outside
this puzzled me for a bit then i had an inspiration on which i went to bed and slept for two troubled hours
i got up at four and opened my bedroom shutters
the faint light of a fine summer morning was flooding the skies and the sparrows had begun to chatter
i had a great revulsion of feeling and felt a godforgotten fool
my inclination was to let things slide and trust to the british police taking a reasonable view of my case
but as i reviewed the situation i could find no arguments to bring against my decision of the previous night so with a wry mouth i resolved to go on with my plan
i was not feeling in any particular funk only disinclined to go looking for trouble if you understand me
i hunted out a wellused tweed suit a pair of strong nailed boots and a flannel shirt with a collar
into my pockets i stuffed a spare shirt a cloth cap some handkerchiefs and a toothbrush
i had drawn a good sum in gold from the bank two days before in case scudder should want money and i took fifty pounds of it in sovereigns in a belt which i had brought back from rhodesia
that was about all i wanted
then i had a bath and cut my moustache which was long and drooping into a short stubbly fringe
now came the next step
paddock used to arrive punctually at 730 and let himself in with a latchkey
but about twenty minutes to seven as i knew from bitter experience the milkman turned up with a great clatter of cans and deposited my share outside my door
i had seen that milkman sometimes when i had gone out for an early ride
he was a young man about my own height with an illnourished moustache and he wore a white overall
on him i staked all my chances
i went into the darkened smokingroom where the rays of morning light were beginning to creep through the shutters
there i breakfasted off a whiskyandsoda and some biscuits from the cupboard
by this time it was getting on for six oclock
i put a pipe in my pocket and filled my pouch from the tobacco jar on the table by the fireplace
as i poked into the tobacco my fingers touched something hard and i drew out scudders little black pocketbook  that seemed to me a good omen
i lifted the cloth from the body and was amazed at the peace and dignity of the dead face
goodbye old chap i said i am going to do my best for you
wish me well wherever you are  then i hung about in the hall waiting for the milkman
that was the worst part of the business for i was fairly choking to get out of doors
sixthirty passed then sixforty but still he did not come
the fool had chosen this day of all days to be late
at one minute after the quarter to seven i heard the rattle of the cans outside
i opened the front door and there was my man singling out my cans from a bunch he carried and whistling through his teeth
he jumped a bit at the sight of me
come in here a moment i said
i want a word with you and i led him into the diningroom
i reckon youre a bit of a sportsman i said and i want you to do me a service
lend me your cap and overall for ten minutes and heres a sovereign for you  his eyes opened at the sight of the gold and he grinned broadly
wots the gymehe asked
a bet i said
i havent time to explain but to win it ive got to be a milkman for the next ten minutes
all youve got to do is to stay here till i come back
youll be a bit late but nobody will complain and youll have that quid for yourself  righto he said cheerily
i aint the man to spoil a bit of sport
eres the rig guvnor  i stuck on his flat blue hat and his white overall picked up the cans banged my door and went whistling downstairs
the porter at the foot told me to shut my jaw which sounded as if my makeup was adequate
at first i thought there was nobody in the street
then i caught sight of a policeman a hundred yards down and a loafer shuffling past on the other side
some impulse made me raise my eyes to the house opposite and there at a firstfloor window was a face
as the loafer passed he looked up and i fancied a signal was exchanged
i crossed the street whistling gaily and imitating the jaunty swing of the milkman
then i took the first side street and went up a lefthand turning which led past a bit of vacant ground
there was no one in the little street so i dropped the milkcans inside the hoarding and sent the cap and overall after them
i had only just put on my cloth cap when a postman came round the corner
i gave him good morning and he answered me unsuspiciously
at the moment the clock of a neighbouring church struck the hour of seven
there was not a second to spare
as soon as i got to euston road i took to my heels and ran
the clock at euston station showed five minutes past the hour
at st pancras i had no time to take a ticket let alone that i had not settled upon my destination
a porter told me the platform and as i entered it i saw the train already in motion
two station officials blocked the way but i dodged them and clambered into the last carriage
three minutes later as we were roaring through the northern tunnels an irate guard interviewed me
he wrote out for me a ticket to newtonstewart a name which had suddenly come back to my memory and he conducted me from the firstclass compartment where i had ensconced myself to a thirdclass smoker occupied by a sailor and a stout woman with a child
he went off grumbling and as i mopped my brow i observed to my companions in my broadest scots that it was a sore job catching trains
i had already entered upon my part
the impidence o that gyaird said the lady bitterly
he needit a scotch tongue to pit him in his place
he was complainin o this wean no haein a ticket and her no fower till august twalmonth and he was objectin to this gentleman spittin  the sailor morosely agreed and i started my new life in an atmosphere of protest against authority
i reminded myself that a week ago i had been finding the world dull
chapter iii
the adventure of the literary innkeeper   i had a solemn time travelling north that day
it was fine may weather with the hawthorn flowering on every hedge and i asked myself why when i was still a free man i had stayed on in london and not got the good of this heavenly country
i didnt dare face the restaurant car but i got a luncheonbasket at leeds and shared it with the fat woman
also i got the mornings papers with news about starters for the derby and the beginning of the cricket season and some paragraphs about how balkan affairs were settling down and a british squadron was going to kiel
when i had done with them i got out scudders little black pocketbook and studied it
it was pretty well filled with jottings chiefly figures though now and then a name was printed in
for example i found the words hofgaard luneville and avocado pretty often and especially the word pavia
now i was certain that scudder never did anything without a reason and i was pretty sure that there was a cypher in all this
that is a subject which has always interested me and i did a bit at it myself once as intelligence officer at delagoa bay during the boer war
i have a head for things like chess and puzzles and i used to reckon myself pretty good at finding out cyphers
this one looked like the numerical kind where sets of figures correspond to the letters of the alphabet but any fairly shrewd man can find the clue to that sort after an hour or twos work and i didnt think scudder would have been content with anything so easy
so i fastened on the printed words for you can make a pretty good numerical cypher if you have a key word which gives you the sequence of the letters
i tried for hours but none of the words answered
then i fell asleep and woke at dumfries just in time to bundle out and get into the slow galloway train
there was a man on the platform whose looks i didnt like but he never glanced at me and when i caught sight of myself in the mirror of an automatic machine i didnt wonder
with my brown face my old tweeds and my slouch i was the very model of one of the hill farmers who were crowding into the thirdclass carriages
i travelled with half a dozen in an atmosphere of shag and clay pipes
they had come from the weekly market and their mouths were full of prices
i heard accounts of how the lambing had gone up the cairn and the deuch and a dozen other mysterious waters
above half the men had lunched heavily and were highly flavoured with whisky so they took no notice of me
we rumbled slowly into a land of little wooded glens and then to a great wide moorland place gleaming with lochs with high blue hills showing northwards
about five oclock the carriage had emptied and i was left alone as i had hoped
i got out at the next station a little place whose name i scarcely noted set right in the heart of a bog
it reminded me of one of those forgotten little stations in the karroo
an old stationmaster was digging in his garden and with his spade over his shoulder sauntered to the train took charge of a parcel and went back to his potatoes
a child of ten received my ticket and i emerged on a white road that straggled over the brown moor
it was a gorgeous spring evening with every hill showing as clear as a cut amethyst
the air had the queer rooty smell of bogs but it was as fresh as midocean and it had the strangest effect on my spirits
i actually felt lighthearted
i might have been a boy out for a spring holiday tramp instead of a man of thirtyseven very much wanted by the police
i felt just as i used to feel when i was starting for a big trek on a frosty morning on the high veld
if you believe me i swung along that road whistling
there was no plan of campaign in my head only just to go on and on in this blessed honestsmelling hill country for every mile put me in better humour with myself
in a roadside planting i cut a walkingstick of hazel and presently struck off the highway up a bypath which followed the glen of a brawling stream
i reckoned that i was still far ahead of any pursuit and for that night might please myself
it was some hours since i had tasted food and i was getting very hungry when i came to a herds cottage set in a nook beside a waterfall
a brownfaced woman was standing by the door and greeted me with the kindly shyness of moorland places
when i asked for a nights lodging she said i was welcome to the bed in the loft and very soon she set before me a hearty meal of ham and eggs scones and thick sweet milk
at the darkening her man came in from the hills a lean giant who in one step covered as much ground as three paces of ordinary mortals
they asked me no questions for they had the perfect breeding of all dwellers in the wilds but i could see they set me down as a kind of dealer and i took some trouble to confirm their view
i spoke a lot about cattle of which my host knew little and i picked up from him a good deal about the local galloway markets which i tucked away in my memory for future use
at ten i was nodding in my chair and the bed in the loft received a weary man who never opened his eyes till five oclock set the little homestead agoing once more
they refused any payment and by six i had breakfasted and was striding southwards again
my notion was to return to the railway line a station or two farther on than the place where i had alighted yesterday and to double back
i reckoned that that was the safest way for the police would naturally assume that i was always making farther from london in the direction of some western port
i thought i had still a good bit of a start for as i reasoned it would take some hours to fix the blame on me and several more to identify the fellow who got on board the train at st pancras
it was the same jolly clear spring weather and i simply could not contrive to feel careworn
indeed i was in better spirits than i had been for months
over a long ridge of moorland i took my road skirting the side of a high hill which the herd had called cairnsmore of fleet
nesting curlews and plovers were crying everywhere and the links of green pasture by the streams were dotted with young lambs
all the slackness of the past months was slipping from my bones and i stepped out like a fouryearold
byandby i came to a swell of moorland which dipped to the vale of a little river and a mile away in the heather i saw the smoke of a train
the station when i reached it proved to be ideal for my purpose
the moor surged up around it and left room only for the single line the slender siding a waitingroom an office the stationmasters cottage and a tiny yard of gooseberries and sweetwilliam
there seemed no road to it from anywhere and to increase the desolation the waves of a tarn lapped on their grey granite beach half a mile away
i waited in the deep heather till i saw the smoke of an eastgoing train on the horizon
then i approached the tiny bookingoffice and took a ticket for dumfries
the only occupants of the carriage were an old shepherd and his doga walleyed brute that i mistrusted
the man was asleep and on the cushions beside him was that mornings scotsman
eagerly i seized on it for i fancied it would tell me something
there were two columns about the portland place murder as it was called
my man paddock had given the alarm and had the milkman arrested
poor devil it looked as if the latter had earned his sovereign hardly but for me he had been cheap at the price for he seemed to have occupied the police for the better part of the day
in the latest news i found a further instalment of the story
the milkman had been released i read and the true criminal about whose identity the police were reticent was believed to have got away from london by one of the northern lines
there was a short note about me as the owner of the flat
i guessed the police had stuck that in as a clumsy contrivance to persuade me that i was unsuspected
there was nothing else in the paper nothing about foreign politics or karolides or the things that had interested scudder
i laid it down and found that we were approaching the station at which i had got out yesterday
the potatodigging stationmaster had been gingered up into some activity for the westgoing train was waiting to let us pass and from it had descended three men who were asking him questions
i supposed that they were the local police who had been stirred up by scotland yard and had traced me as far as this onehorse siding
sitting well back in the shadow i watched them carefully
one of them had a book and took down notes
the old potatodigger seemed to have turned peevish but the child who had collected my ticket was talking volubly
all the party looked out across the moor where the white road departed
i hoped they were going to take up my tracks there
as we moved away from that station my companion woke up
he fixed me with a wandering glance kicked his dog viciously and inquired where he was
clearly he was very drunk
thats what comes o bein a teetotaller he observed in bitter regret
i expressed my surprise that in him i should have met a blueribbon stalwart
ay but im a strong teetotaller he said pugnaciously
i took the pledge last martinmas and i havena touched a drop o whisky sinsyne
not even at hogmanay though i was sair temptit  he swung his heels up on the seat and burrowed a frowsy head into the cushions
and thats a i get he moaned
a heid better than hell fire and twae een lookin different ways for the sabbath  what did it i asked
a drink they ca brandy
bein a teetotaller i keepit off the whisky but i was nipnippin a day at this brandy and i doubt ill no be weel for a fortnicht his voice died away into a splutter and sleep once more laid its heavy hand on him
my plan had been to get out at some station down the line but the train suddenly gave me a better chance for it came to a standstill at the end of a culvert which spanned a brawling portercoloured river
i looked out and saw that every carriage window was closed and no human figure appeared in the landscape
so i opened the door and dropped quickly into the tangle of hazels which edged the line
it would have been all right but for that infernal dog
under the impression that i was decamping with its masters belongings it started to bark and all but got me by the trousers
this woke up the herd who stood bawling at the carriage door in the belief that i had committed suicide
i crawled through the thicket reached the edge of the stream and in cover of the bushes put a hundred yards or so behind me
then from my shelter i peered back and saw the guard and several passengers gathered round the open carriage door and staring in my direction
i could not have made a more public departure if i had left with a bugler and a brass band
happily the drunken herd provided a diversion
he and his dog which was attached by a rope to his waist suddenly cascaded out of the carriage landed on their heads on the track and rolled some way down the bank towards the water
in the rescue which followed the dog bit somebody for i could hear the sound of hard swearing
presently they had forgotten me and when after a quarter of a miles crawl i ventured to look back the train had started again and was vanishing in the cutting
i was in a wide semicircle of moorland with the brown river as radius and the high hills forming the northern circumference
there was not a sign or sound of a human being only the plashing water and the interminable crying of curlews
yet oddly enough for the first time i felt the terror of the hunted on me
it was not the police that i thought of but the other folk who knew that i knew scudders secret and dared not let me live
i was certain that they would pursue me with a keenness and vigilance unknown to the british law and that once their grip closed on me i should find no mercy
i looked back but there was nothing in the landscape
the sun glinted on the metals of the line and the wet stones in the stream and you could not have found a more peaceful sight in the world
nevertheless i started to run
crouching low in the runnels of the bog i ran till the sweat blinded my eyes
the mood did not leave me till i had reached the rim of mountain and flung myself panting on a ridge high above the young waters of the brown river
from my vantageground i could scan the whole moor right away to the railway line and to the south of it where green fields took the place of heather
i have eyes like a hawk but i could see nothing moving in the whole countryside
then i looked east beyond the ridge and saw a new kind of landscapeshallow green valleys with plentiful fir plantations and the faint lines of dust which spoke of highroads
last of all i looked into the blue may sky and there i saw that which set my pulses racing  low down in the south a monoplane was climbing into the heavens
i was as certain as if i had been told that that aeroplane was looking for me and that it did not belong to the police
for an hour or two i watched it from a pit of heather
it flew low along the hilltops and then in narrow circles over the valley up which i had come
then it seemed to change its mind rose to a great height and flew away back to the south
i did not like this espionage from the air and i began to think less well of the countryside i had chosen for a refuge
these heather hills were no sort of cover if my enemies were in the sky and i must find a different kind of sanctuary
i looked with more satisfaction to the green country beyond the ridge for there i should find woods and stone houses
about six in the evening i came out of the moorland to a white ribbon of road which wound up the narrow vale of a lowland stream
as i followed it fields gave place to bent the glen became a plateau and presently i had reached a kind of pass where a solitary house smoked in the twilight
the road swung over a bridge and leaning on the parapet was a young man
he was smoking a long clay pipe and studying the water with spectacled eyes
in his left hand was a small book with a finger marking the place
slowly he repeated  as when a gryphon through the wilderness with wingèd step oer hill and moory dale pursues the arimaspian
he jumped round as my step rung on the keystone and i saw a pleasant sunburnt boyish face
good evening to you he said gravely
its a fine night for the road  the smell of peat smoke and of some savoury roast floated to me from the house
is that place an inn i asked
at your service he said politely
i am the landlord sir and i hope you will stay the night for to tell you the truth i have had no company for a week  i pulled myself up on the parapet of the bridge and filled my pipe
i began to detect an ally
youre young to be an innkeeper i said
my father died a year ago and left me the business
i live there with my grandmother
its a slow job for a young man and it wasnt my choice of profession  which was  he actually blushed
i want to write books he said
and what better chance could you ask i cried
man ive often thought that an innkeeper would make the best storyteller in the world  not now he said eagerly
maybe in the old days when you had pilgrims and balladmakers and highwaymen and mailcoaches on the road
but not now
nothing comes here but motorcars full of fat women who stop for lunch and a fisherman or two in the spring and the shooting tenants in august
there is not much material to be got out of that
i want to see life to travel the world and write things like kipling and conrad
but the most ive done yet is to get some verses printed in chamberss journal  i looked at the inn standing golden in the sunset against the brown hills
ive knocked a bit about the world and i wouldnt despise such a hermitage
dyou think that adventure is found only in the tropics or among gentry in red shirts
maybe youre rubbing shoulders with it at this moment  thats what kipling says he said his eyes brightening and he quoted some verse about romance brings up the 915  heres a true tale for you then i cried and a month from now you can make a novel out of it  sitting on the bridge in the soft may gloaming i pitched him a lovely yarn
it was true in essentials too though i altered the minor details
i made out that i was a mining magnate from kimberley who had had a lot of trouble with idb
and had shown up a gang
they had pursued me across the ocean and had killed my best friend and were now on my tracks
i told the story well though i say it who shouldnt
i pictured a flight across the kalahari to german africa the crackling parching days the wonderful bluevelvet nights
i described an attack on my life on the voyage home and i made a really horrid affair of the portland place murder
youre looking for adventure i cried well youve found it here
the devils are after me and the police are after them
its a race that i mean to win  by god he whispered drawing his breath in sharply it is all pure rider haggard and conan doyle  you believe me i said gratefully
of course i do and he held out his hand
i believe everything out of the common
the only thing to distrust is the normal  he was very young but he was the man for my money
i think theyre off my track for the moment but i must lie close for a couple of days
can you take me in  he caught my elbow in his eagerness and drew me towards the house
you can lie as snug here as if you were in a mosshole
ill see that nobody blabs either
and youll give me some more material about your adventures  as i entered the inn porch i heard from far off the beat of an engine
there silhouetted against the dusky west was my friend the monoplane
he gave me a room at the back of the house with a fine outlook over the plateau and he made me free of his own study which was stacked with cheap editions of his favourite authors
i never saw the grandmother so i guessed she was bedridden
an old woman called margit brought me my meals and the innkeeper was around me at all hours
i wanted some time to myself so i invented a job for him
he had a motor bicycle and i sent him off next morning for the daily paper which usually arrived with the post in the late afternoon
i told him to keep his eyes skinned and make note of any strange figures he saw keeping a special sharp lookout for motors and aeroplanes
then i sat down in real earnest to scudders notebook
he came back at midday with the scotsman
there was nothing in it except some further evidence of paddock and the milkman and a repetition of yesterdays statement that the murderer had gone north
but there was a long article reprinted from the times about karolides and the state of affairs in the balkans though there was no mention of any visit to england
i got rid of the innkeeper for the afternoon for i was getting very warm in my search for the cypher
as i told you it was a numerical cypher and by an elaborate system of experiments i had pretty well discovered what were the nulls and stops
the trouble was the key word and when i thought of the odd million words he might have used i felt pretty hopeless
but about three oclock i had a sudden inspiration
the name julia czechenyi flashed across my memory
scudder had said it was the key to the karolides business and it occurred to me to try it on his cypher
it worked
the five letters of julia gave me the position of the vowels
a was j the tenth letter of the alphabet and so represented by x in the cypher
e was uxxi and so on
czechenyi gave me the numerals for the principal consonants
i scribbled that scheme on a bit of paper and sat down to read scudders pages
in half an hour i was reading with a whitish face and fingers that drummed on the table
i glanced out of the window and saw a big touringcar coming up the glen towards the inn
it drew up at the door and there was the sound of people alighting
there seemed to be two of them men in aquascutums and tweed caps
ten minutes later the innkeeper slipped into the room his eyes bright with excitement
theres two chaps below looking for you he whispered
theyre in the diningroom having whiskiesandsodas
they asked about you and said they had hoped to meet you here
oh
and they described you jolly well down to your boots and shirt
i told them you had been here last night and had gone off on a motor bicycle this morning and one of the chaps swore like a navvy  i made him tell me what they looked like
one was a darkeyed thin fellow with bushy eyebrows the other was always smiling and lisped in his talk
neither was any kind of foreigner on this my young friend was positive
i took a bit of paper and wrote these words in german as if they were part of a letter   black stone
scudder had got on to this but he could not act for a fortnight
i doubt if i can do any good now especially as karolides is uncertain about his plans
but if mr t advises i will do the best i   i manufactured it rather neatly so that it looked like a loose page of a private letter
take this down and say it was found in my bedroom and ask them to return it to me if they overtake me  three minutes later i heard the car begin to move and peeping from behind the curtain caught sight of the two figures
one was slim the other was sleek that was the most i could make of my reconnaissance
the innkeeper appeared in great excitement
your paper woke them up he said gleefully
the dark fellow went as white as death and cursed like blazes and the fat one whistled and looked ugly
they paid for their drinks with halfasovereign and wouldnt wait for change  now ill tell you what i want you to do i said
get on your bicycle and go off to newtonstewart to the chief constable
describe the two men and say you suspect them of having had something to do with the london murder
you can invent reasons
the two will come back never fear
not tonight for theyll follow me forty miles along the road but first thing tomorrow morning
tell the police to be here bright and early  he set off like a docile child while i worked at scudders notes
when he came back we dined together and in common decency i had to let him pump me
i gave him a lot of stuff about lion hunts and the matabele war thinking all the while what tame businesses these were compared to this i was now engaged in
when he went to bed i sat up and finished scudder
i smoked in a chair till daylight for i could not sleep
about eight next morning i witnessed the arrival of two constables and a sergeant
they put their car in a coachhouse under the innkeepers instructions and entered the house
twenty minutes later i saw from my window a second car come across the plateau from the opposite direction
it did not come up to the inn but stopped two hundred yards off in the shelter of a patch of wood
i noticed that its occupants carefully reversed it before leaving it
a minute or two later i heard their steps on the gravel outside the window
my plan had been to lie hid in my bedroom and see what happened
i had a notion that if i could bring the police and my other more dangerous pursuers together something might work out of it to my advantage
but now i had a better idea
i scribbled a line of thanks to my host opened the window and dropped quietly into a gooseberry bush
unobserved i crossed the dyke crawled down the side of a tributary burn and won the highroad on the far side of the patch of trees
there stood the car very spick and span in the morning sunlight but with the dust on her which told of a long journey
i started her jumped into the chauffeurs seat and stole gently out on to the plateau
almost at once the road dipped so that i lost sight of the inn but the wind seemed to bring me the sound of angry voices
chapter iv
the adventure of the radical candidate   you may picture me driving that 40 hp
car for all she was worth over the crisp moor roads on that shining may morning glancing back at first over my shoulder and looking anxiously to the next turning then driving with a vague eye just wide enough awake to keep on the highway
for i was thinking desperately of what i had found in scudders pocketbook
the little man had told me a pack of lies
all his yarns about the balkans and the jewanarchists and the foreign office conference were eyewash and so was karolides
and yet not quite as you shall hear
i had staked everything on my belief in his story and had been let down here was his book telling me a different tale and instead of being oncebittentwiceshy i believed it absolutely
why i dont know
it rang desperately true and the first yarn if you understand me had been in a queer way true also in spirit
the fifteenth day of june was going to be a day of destiny a bigger destiny than the killing of a dago
it was so big that i didnt blame scudder for keeping me out of the game and wanting to play a lone hand
that i was pretty clear was his intention
he had told me something which sounded big enough but the real thing was so immortally big that he the man who had found it out wanted it all for himself
i didnt blame him
it was risks after all that he was chiefly greedy about
the whole story was in the noteswith gaps you understand which he would have filled up from his memory
he stuck down his authorities too and had an odd trick of giving them all a numerical value and then striking a balance which stood for the reliability of each stage in the yarn
the four names he had printed were authorities and there was a man ducrosne who got five out of a possible five and another fellow ammersfoort who got three
the bare bones of the tale were all that was in the bookthese and one queer phrase which occurred half a dozen times inside brackets
thirtynine steps was the phrase and at its last time of use it ranthirtynine steps i counted themhigh tide 1017 pm
i could make nothing of that
the first thing i learned was that it was no question of preventing a war
that was coming as sure as christmas had been arranged said scudder ever since february 1912
karolides was going to be the occasion
he was booked all right and was to hand in his checks on june 14th two weeks and four days from that may morning
i gathered from scudders notes that nothing on earth could prevent that
his talk of epirote guards that would skin their own grandmothers was all billyo
the second thing was that this war was going to come as a mighty surprise to britain
karolides death would set the balkans by the ears and then vienna would chip in with an ultimatum
russia wouldnt like that and there would be high words
but berlin would play the peacemaker and pour oil on the waters till suddenly she would find a good cause for a quarrel pick it up and in five hours let fly at us
that was the idea and a pretty good one too
honey and fair speeches and then a stroke in the dark
while we were talking about the goodwill and good intentions of germany our coast would be silently ringed with mines and submarines would be waiting for every battleship
but all this depended upon the third thing which was due to happen on june 15th
i would never have grasped this if i hadnt once happened to meet a french staff officer coming back from west africa who had told me a lot of things
one was that in spite of all the nonsense talked in parliament there was a real working alliance between france and britain and that the two general staffs met every now and then and made plans for joint action in case of war
well in june a very great swell was coming over from paris and he was going to get nothing less than a statement of the disposition of the british home fleet on mobilization
at least i gathered it was something like that anyhow it was something uncommonly important
but on the 15th day of june there were to be others in londonothers at whom i could only guess
scudder was content to call them collectively the black stone
they represented not our allies but our deadly foes and the information destined for france was to be diverted to their pockets
and it was to be used rememberused a week or two later with great guns and swift torpedoes suddenly in the darkness of a summer night
this was the story i had been deciphering in a back room of a country inn overlooking a cabbage garden
this was the story that hummed in my brain as i swung in the big touringcar from glen to glen
my first impulse had been to write a letter to the prime minister but a little reflection convinced me that that would be useless
who would believe my tale
i must show a sign some token in proof and heaven knew what that could be
above all i must keep going myself ready to act when things got riper and that was going to be no light job with the police of the british isles in full cry after me and the watchers of the black stone running silently and swiftly on my trail
i had no very clear purpose in my journey but i steered east by the sun for i remembered from the map that if i went north i would come into a region of coalpits and industrial towns
presently i was down from the moorlands and traversing the broad haugh of a river
for miles i ran alongside a park wall and in a break of the trees i saw a great castle
i swung through little old thatched villages and over peaceful lowland streams and past gardens blazing with hawthorn and yellow laburnum
the land was so deep in peace that i could scarcely believe that somewhere behind me were those who sought my life ay and that in a months time unless i had the almightiest of luck these round country faces would be pinched and staring and men would be lying dead in english fields
about midday i entered a long straggling village and had a mind to stop and eat
halfway down was the post office and on the steps of it stood the postmistress and a policeman hard at work conning a telegram
when they saw me they wakened up and the policeman advanced with raised hand and cried on me to stop
i nearly was fool enough to obey
then it flashed upon me that the wire had to do with me that my friends at the inn had come to an understanding and were united in desiring to see more of me and that it had been easy enough for them to wire the description of me and the car to thirty villages through which i might pass
i released the brakes just in time
as it was the policeman made a claw at the hood and only dropped off when he got my left in his eye
i saw that main roads were no place for me and turned into the byways
it wasnt an easy job without a map for there was the risk of getting on to a farm road and ending in a duckpond or a stableyard and i couldnt afford that kind of delay
i began to see what an ass i had been to steal the car
the big green brute would be the safest kind of clue to me over the breadth of scotland
if i left it and took to my feet it would be discovered in an hour or two and i would get no start in the race
the immediate thing to do was to get to the loneliest roads
these i soon found when i struck up a tributary of the big river and got into a glen with steep hills all about me and a corkscrew road at the end which climbed over a pass
here i met nobody but it was taking me too far north so i slewed east along a bad track and finally struck a big doubleline railway
away below me i saw another broadish valley and it occurred to me that if i crossed it i might find some remote inn to pass the night
the evening was now drawing in and i was furiously hungry for i had eaten nothing since breakfast except a couple of buns i had bought from a bakers cart
just then i heard a noise in the sky and lo and behold there was that infernal aeroplane flying low about a dozen miles to the south and rapidly coming towards me
i had the sense to remember that on a bare moor i was at the aeroplanes mercy and that my only chance was to get to the leafy cover of the valley
down the hill i went like blue lightning screwing my head round whenever i dared to watch that damned flying machine
soon i was on a road between hedges and dipping to the deepcut glen of a stream
then came a bit of thick wood where i slackened speed
suddenly on my left i heard the hoot of another car and realized to my horror that i was almost up on a couple of gateposts through which a private road debouched on the highway
my horn gave an agonized roar but it was too late
i clapped on my brakes but my impetus was too great and there before me a car was sliding athwart my course
in a second there would have been the deuce of a wreck
i did the only thing possible and ran slap into the hedge on the right trusting to find something soft beyond
but there i was mistaken
my car slithered through the hedge like butter and then gave a sickening plunge forward
i saw what was coming leapt on the seat and would have jumped out
but a branch of hawthorn got me in the chest lifted me up and held me while a ton or two of expensive metal slipped below me bucked and pitched and then dropped with an almighty smash fifty feet to the bed of the stream
slowly that thorn let me go
i subsided first on the hedge and then very gently on a bower of nettles
as i scrambled to my feet a hand took me by the arm and a sympathetic and badly scared voice asked me if i were hurt
i found myself looking at a tall young man in goggles and a leather ulster who kept on blessing his soul and whinnying apologies
for myself once i got my wind back i was rather glad than otherwise
this was one way of getting rid of the car
my blame sir i answered him
its lucky that i did not add homicide to my follies
thats the end of my scotch motor tour but it might have been the end of my life  he plucked out a watch and studied it
youre the right sort of fellow he said
i can spare a quarter of an hour and my house is two minutes off
ill see you clothed and fed and snug in bed
wheres your kit by the way
is it in the burn along with the car  its in my pocket i said brandishing a toothbrush
im a colonial and travel light  a colonial he cried
by gad youre the very man ive been praying for
are you by any blessed chance a free trader  i am said i without the foggiest notion of what he meant
he patted my shoulder and hurried me into his car
three minutes later we drew up before a comfortablelooking shootingbox set among pine trees and he ushered me indoors
he took me first to a bedroom and flung half a dozen of his suits before me for my own had been pretty well reduced to rags
i selected a loose blue serge which differed most conspicuously from my former garments and borrowed a linen collar
then he haled me to the diningroom where the remnants of a meal stood on the table and announced that i had just five minutes to feed
you can take a snack in your pocket and well have supper when we get back
ive got to be at the masonic hall at eight oclock or my agent will comb my hair  i had a cup of coffee and some cold ham while he yarned away on the hearthrug
you find me in the deuce of a mess mr  bytheby you havent told me your name
twisdon
any relation of old tommy twisdon of the sixtieth
no
well you see im liberal candidate for this part of the world and i had a meeting on tonight at brattleburnthats my chief town and an infernal tory stronghold
i had got the colonial expremier fellow crumpleton coming to speak for me tonight and had the thing tremendously billed and the whole place groundbaited
this afternoon i had a wire from the ruffian saying he had got influenza at blackpool and here am i left to do the whole thing myself
i had meant to speak for ten minutes and must now go on for forty and though ive been racking my brains for three hours to think of something i simply cannot last the course
now youve got to be a good chap and help me
youre a free trader and can tell our people what a washout protection is in the colonies
all you fellows have the gift of the gabi wish to heaven i had it
ill be for evermore in your debt  i had very few notions about free trade one way or the other but i saw no other chance to get what i wanted
my young gentleman was far too absorbed in his own difficulties to think how odd it was to ask a stranger who had just missed death by an ace and had lost a 1000guinea car to address a meeting for him on the spur of the moment
but my necessities did not allow me to contemplate oddnesses or to pick and choose my supports
all right i said
im not much good as a speaker but ill tell them a bit about australia  at my words the cares of the ages slipped from his shoulders and he was rapturous in his thanks
he lent me a big driving coatand never troubled to ask why i had started on a motor tour without possessing an ulsterand as we slipped down the dusty roads poured into my ears the simple facts of his history
he was an orphan and his uncle had brought him upive forgotten the uncles name but he was in the cabinet and you can read his speeches in the papers
he had gone round the world after leaving cambridge and then being short of a job his uncle had advised politics
i gathered that he had no preference in parties
good chaps in both he said cheerfully and plenty of blighters too
im liberal because my family have always been whigs but if he was lukewarm politically he had strong views on other things
he found out i knew a bit about horses and jawed away about the derby entries and he was full of plans for improving his shooting
altogether a very clean decent callow young man
as we passed through a little town two policemen signalled us to stop and flashed their lanterns on us
beg pardon sir harry said one
weve got instructions to look out for a car and the descriptions no unlike yours  righto said my host while i thanked providence for the devious ways i had been brought to safety
after that he spoke no more for his mind began to labour heavily with his coming speech
his lips kept muttering his eye wandered and i began to prepare myself for a second catastrophe
i tried to think of something to say myself but my mind was dry as a stone
the next thing i knew we had drawn up outside a door in a street and were being welcomed by some noisy gentlemen with rosettes
the hall had about five hundred in it women mostly a lot of bald heads and a dozen or two young men
the chairman a weaselly minister with a reddish nose lamented crumpletons absence soliloquized on his influenza and gave me a certificate as a trusted leader of australian thought
there were two policemen at the door and i hoped they took note of that testimonial
then sir harry started
i never heard anything like it
he didnt begin to know how to talk
he had about a bushel of notes from which he read and when he let go of them he fell into one prolonged stutter
every now and then he remembered a phrase he had learned by heart straightened his back and gave it off like henry irving and the next moment he was bent double and crooning over his papers
it was the most appalling rot too
he talked about the german menace and said it was all a tory invention to cheat the poor of their rights and keep back the great flood of social reform but that organized labour realized this and laughed the tories to scorn
he was all for reducing our navy as a proof of our good faith and then sending germany an ultimatum telling her to do the same or we would knock her into a cocked hat
he said that but for the tories germany and britain would be fellowworkers in peace and reform
i thought of the little black book in my pocket
a giddy lot scudders friends cared for peace and reform
yet in a queer way i liked the speech
you could see the niceness of the chap shining out behind the muck with which he had been spoonfed
also it took a load off my mind
i mightnt be much of an orator but i was a thousand per cent better than sir harry
i didnt get on so badly when it came to my turn
i simply told them all i could remember about australia praying there should be no australian thereall about its labour party and emigration and universal service
i doubt if i remembered to mention free trade but i said there were no tories in australia only labour and liberals
that fetched a cheer and i woke them up a bit when i started in to tell them the kind of glorious business i thought could be made out of the empire if we really put our backs into it
altogether i fancy i was rather a success
the minister didnt like me though and when he proposed a vote of thanks spoke of sir harrys speech as statesmanlike and mine as having the eloquence of an emigration agent  when we were in the car again my host was in wild spirits at having got his job over
a ripping speech twisdon he said
now youre coming home with me
im all alone and if youll stop a day or two ill show you some very decent fishing  we had a hot supperand i wanted it pretty badlyand then drank grog in a big cheery smokingroom with a crackling wood fire
i thought the time had come for me to put my cards on the table
i saw by this mans eye that he was the kind you can trust
listen sir harry i said
ive something pretty important to say to you
youre a good fellow and im going to be frank
where on earth did you get that poisonous rubbish you talked tonight  his face fell
was it as bad as that he asked ruefully
it did sound rather thin
i got most of it out of the progressive magazine and pamphlets that agent chap of mine keeps sending me
but you surely dont think germany would ever go to war with us  ask that question in six weeks and it wont need an answer i said
if youll give me your attention for half an hour i am going to tell you a story  i can see yet that bright room with the deers heads and the old prints on the walls sir harry standing restlessly on the stone curb of the hearth and myself lying back in an armchair speaking
i seemed to be another person standing aside and listening to my own voice and judging carefully the reliability of my tale
it was the first time i had ever told anyone the exact truth so far as i understood it and it did me no end of good for it straightened out the thing in my own mind
i blinked no detail
he heard all about scudder and the milkman and the notebook and my doings in galloway
presently he got very excited and walked up and down the hearthrug
so you see i concluded you have got here in your house the man that is wanted for the portland place murder
your duty is to send your car for the police and give me up
i dont think ill get very far
therell be an accident and ill have a knife in my ribs an hour or so after arrest
nevertheless its your duty as a lawabiding citizen
perhaps in a months time youll be sorry but you have no cause to think of that  he was looking at me with bright steady eyes
what was your job in rhodesia mr hannay he asked
mining engineer i said
ive made my pile cleanly and ive had a good time in the making of it  not a profession that weakens the nerves is it  i laughed
oh as to that my nerves are good enough i took down a huntingknife from a stand on the wall and did the old mashona trick of tossing it and catching it in my lips
that wants a pretty steady heart
he watched me with a smile
i dont want proofs
i may be an ass on the platform but i can size up a man
youre no murderer and youre no fool and i believe you are speaking the truth
im going to back you up
now what can i do  first i want you to write a letter to your uncle
ive got to get in touch with the government people sometime before the 15th of june  he pulled his moustache
that wont help you
this is foreign office business and my uncle would have nothing to do with it
besides youd never convince him
no ill go one better
ill write to the permanent secretary at the foreign office
hes my godfather and one of the best going
what do you want  he sat down at a table and wrote to my dictation
the gist of it was that if a man called twisdon i thought i had better stick to that name turned up before june 15th he was to entreat him kindly
he said twisdon would prove his bona fides by passing the word black stone and whistling annie laurie
good said sir harry
thats the proper style
by the way youll find my godfatherhis names sir walter bullivantdown at his country cottage for whitsuntide
its close to artinswell on the kennet
thats done
now whats the next thing  youre about my height
lend me the oldest tweed suit youve got
anything will do so long as the colour is the opposite of the clothes i destroyed this afternoon
then show me a map of the neighbourhood and explain to me the lie of the land
lastly if the police come seeking me just show them the car in the glen
if the other lot turn up tell them i caught the south express after your meeting  he did or promised to do all these things
i shaved off the remnants of my moustache and got inside an ancient suit of what i believe is called heather mixture
the map gave me some notion of my whereabouts and told me the two things i wanted to knowwhere the main railway to the south could be joined and what were the wildest districts near at hand
at two oclock he wakened me from my slumbers in the smokingroom armchair and led me blinking into the dark starry night
an old bicycle was found in a toolshed and handed over to me
first turn to the right up by the long firwood he enjoined
by daybreak youll be well into the hills
then i should pitch the machine into a bog and take to the moors on foot
you can put in a week among the shepherds and be as safe as if you were in new guinea  i pedalled diligently up steep roads of hill gravel till the skies grew pale with morning
as the mists cleared before the sun i found myself in a wide green world with glens falling on every side and a faraway blue horizon
here at any rate i could get early news of my enemies
chapter v the adventure of the spectacled roadman   i sat down on the very crest of the pass and took stock of my position
behind me was the road climbing through a long cleft in the hills which was the upper glen of some notable river
in front was a flat space of maybe a mile all pitted with bogholes and rough with tussocks and then beyond it the road fell steeply down another glen to a plain whose blue dimness melted into the distance
to left and right were roundshouldered green hills as smooth as pancakes but to the souththat is the left handthere was a glimpse of high heathery mountains which i remembered from the map as the big knot of hill which i had chosen for my sanctuary
i was on the central boss of a huge upland country and could see everything moving for miles
in the meadows below the road half a mile back a cottage smoked but it was the only sign of human life
otherwise there was only the calling of plovers and the tinkling of little streams
it was now about seven oclock and as i waited i heard once again that ominous beat in the air
then i realized that my vantageground might be in reality a trap
there was no cover for a tomtit in those bald green places
i sat quite still and hopeless while the beat grew louder
then i saw an aeroplane coming up from the east
it was flying high but as i looked it dropped several hundred feet and began to circle round the knot of hill in narrowing circles just as a hawk wheels before it pounces
now it was flying very low and now the observer on board caught sight of me
i could see one of the two occupants examining me through glasses
suddenly it began to rise in swift whorls and the next i knew it was speeding eastward again till it became a speck in the blue morning
that made me do some savage thinking
my enemies had located me and the next thing would be a cordon round me
i didnt know what force they could command but i was certain it would be sufficient
the aeroplane had seen my bicycle and would conclude that i would try to escape by the road
in that case there might be a chance on the moors to the right or left
i wheeled the machine a hundred yards from the highway and plunged it into a mosshole where it sank among pondweed and waterbuttercups
then i climbed to a knoll which gave me a view of the two valleys
nothing was stirring on the long white ribbon that threaded them
i have said there was not cover in the whole place to hide a rat
as the day advanced it was flooded with soft fresh light till it had the fragrant sunniness of the south african veld
at other times i would have liked the place but now it seemed to suffocate me
the free moorlands were prison walls and the keen hill air was the breath of a dungeon
i tossed a coinheads right tails leftand it fell heads so i turned to the north
in a little i came to the brow of the ridge which was the containing wall of the pass
i saw the highroad for maybe ten miles and far down it something that was moving and that i took to be a motorcar
beyond the ridge i looked on a rolling green moor which fell away into wooded glens
now my life on the veld has given me the eyes of a kite and i can see things for which most men need a telescope away down the slope a couple of miles away several men were advancing like a row of beaters at a shoot
i dropped out of sight behind the skyline
that way was shut to me and i must try the bigger hills to the south beyond the highway
the car i had noticed was getting nearer but it was still a long way off with some very steep gradients before it
i ran hard crouching low except in the hollows and as i ran i kept scanning the brow of the hill before me
was it imagination or did i see figuresone two perhaps moremoving in a glen beyond the stream
if you are hemmed in on all sides in a patch of land there is only one chance of escape
you must stay in the patch and let your enemies search it and not find you
that was good sense but how on earth was i to escape notice in that tablecloth of a place
i would have buried myself to the neck in mud or lain below water or climbed the tallest tree
but there was not a stick of wood the bogholes were little puddles the stream was a slender trickle
there was nothing but short heather and bare hill bent and the white highway
then in a tiny bight of road beside a heap of stones i found the roadman
he had just arrived and was wearily flinging down his hammer
he looked at me with a fishy eye and yawned
confoond the day i ever left the herdin he said as if to the world at large
there i was my ain maister
now im a slave to the goavernment tethered to the roadside wi sair een and a back like a suckle  he took up the hammer struck a stone dropped the implement with an oath and put both hands to his ears
mercy on me
my heids burstin he cried
he was a wild figure about my own size but much bent with a weeks beard on his chin and a pair of big horn spectacles
i canna daet he cried again
the surveyor maun just report me
im for my bed  i asked him what was the trouble though indeed that was clear enough
the trouble is that im no sober
last nicht my dochter merran was waddit and they danced till fower in the byre
me and some ither chiels sat down to the drinkin and here i am
peety that i ever lookit on the wine when it was red  i agreed with him about bed
its easy speakin he moaned
but i got a postcard yestreen sayin that the new road surveyor would be round the day
hell come and hell no find me or else hell find me fou and either way im a done man
ill awa back to my bed and say im no weel but i doot thatll no help me for they ken my kind o noweelness  then i had an inspiration
does the new surveyor know you i asked
no him
hes just been a week at the job
he rins about in a wee motorcawr and wad speir the inside oot o a whelk  wheres your house i asked and was directed by a wavering finger to the cottage by the stream
well back to your bed i said and sleep in peace
ill take on your job for a bit and see the surveyor  he stared at me blankly then as the notion dawned on his fuddled brain his face broke into the vacant drunkards smile
youre the billy he cried
itll be easy eneuch managed
ive finished that bing o stanes so you needna chap ony mair this forenoon
just take the barry and wheel eneuch metal frae yon quarry doon the road to mak anither bing the morn
my names alexander trummle and ive been seeven year at the trade and twenty afore that herdin on leithen water
my freens ca me ecky and whiles specky for i wear glesses being waik i the sicht
just you speak the surveyor fair and ca him sir and hell be fell pleased
ill be back or midday  i borrowed his spectacles and filthy old hat stripped off coat waistcoat and collar and gave him them to carry home borrowed too the foul stump of a clay pipe as an extra property
he indicated my simple tasks and without more ado set off at an amble bedwards
bed may have been his chief object but i think there was also something left in the foot of a bottle
i prayed that he might be safe under cover before my friends arrived on the scene
then i set to work to dress for the part
i opened the collar of my shirtit was a vulgar blueandwhite check such as ploughmen wearand revealed a neck as brown as any tinkers
i rolled up my sleeves and there was a forearm which might have been a blacksmiths sunburnt and rough with old scars
i got my boots and trouserlegs all white from the dust of the road and hitched up my trousers tying them with string below the knee
then i set to work on my face
with a handful of dust i made a watermark round my neck the place where mr turnbulls sunday ablutions might be expected to stop
i rubbed a good deal of dirt also into the sunburn of my cheeks
a roadmans eyes would no doubt be a little inflamed so i contrived to get some dust in both of mine and by dint of vigorous rubbing produced a bleary effect
the sandwiches sir harry had given me had gone off with my coat but the roadmans lunch tied up in a red handkerchief was at my disposal
i ate with great relish several of the thick slabs of scone and cheese and drank a little of the cold tea
in the handkerchief was a local paper tied with string and addressed to mr turnbullobviously meant to solace his midday leisure
i did up the bundle again and put the paper conspicuously beside it
my boots did not satisfy me but by dint of kicking among the stones i reduced them to the granitelike surface which marks a roadmans footgear
then i bit and scraped my fingernails till the edges were all cracked and uneven
the men i was matched against would miss no detail
i broke one of the bootlaces and retied it in a clumsy knot and loosed the other so that my thick grey socks bulged over the uppers
still no sign of anything on the road
the motor i had observed half an hour ago must have gone home
my toilet complete i took up the barrow and began my journeys to and from the quarry a hundred yards off
i remember an old scout in rhodesia who had done many queer things in his day once telling me that the secret of playing a part was to think yourself into it
you could never keep it up he said unless you could manage to convince yourself that you were it
so i shut off all other thoughts and switched them on to the roadmending
i thought of the little white cottage as my home i recalled the years i had spent herding on leithen water i made my mind dwell lovingly on sleep in a boxbed and a bottle of cheap whisky
still nothing appeared on that long white road
now and then a sheep wandered off the heather to stare at me
a heron flopped down to a pool in the stream and started to fish taking no more notice of me than if i had been a milestone
on i went trundling my loads of stone with the heavy step of the professional
soon i grew warm and the dust on my face changed into solid and abiding grit
i was already counting the hours till evening should put a limit to mr turnbulls monotonous toil
suddenly a crisp voice spoke from the road and looking up i saw a little ford twoseater and a roundfaced young man in a bowler hat
are you alexander turnbull he asked
i am the new county road surveyor
you live at blackhopefoot and have charge of the section from laidlawbyres to the riggs
good
a fair bit of road turnbull and not badly engineered
a little soft about a mile off and the edges want cleaning
see you look after that
good morning
youll know me the next time you see me  clearly my getup was good enough for the dreaded surveyor
i went on with my work and as the morning grew towards noon i was cheered by a little traffic
a bakers van breasted the hill and sold me a bag of ginger biscuits which i stowed in my trouserpockets against emergencies
then a herd passed with sheep and disturbed me somewhat by asking loudly what had become o specky  in bed wi the colic i replied and the herd passed on  just about midday a big car stole down the hill glided past and drew up a hundred yards beyond
its three occupants descended as if to stretch their legs and sauntered towards me
two of the men i had seen before from the window of the galloway innone lean sharp and dark the other comfortable and smiling
the third had the look of a countrymana vet perhaps or a small farmer
he was dressed in illcut knickerbockers and the eye in his head was as bright and wary as a hens
morning said the last
thats a fine easy job o yours  i had not looked up on their approach and now when accosted i slowly and painfully straightened my back after the manner of roadmen spat vigorously after the manner of the low scot and regarded them steadily before replying
i confronted three pairs of eyes that missed nothing
theres waur jobs and theres better i said sententiously
i wad rather hae yours sittin a day on your hinderlands on thae cushions
its you and your muckle cawrs that wreck my roads
if we a had oor richts ye sud be made to mend what ye break  the brighteyed man was looking at the newspaper lying beside turnbulls bundle
i see you get your papers in good time he said
i glanced at it casually
aye in gude time
seein that that paper cam out last setterday im just sax days late  he picked it up glanced at the superscription and laid it down again
one of the others had been looking at my boots and a word in german called the speakers attention to them
youve a fine taste in boots he said
these were never made by a country shoemaker  they were not i said readily
they were made in london
i got them frae the gentleman that was here last year for the shootin
what was his name now and i scratched a forgetful head
again the sleek one spoke in german
let us get on he said
this fellow is all right  they asked one last question
did you see anyone pass early this morning
he might be on a bicycle or he might be on foot  i very nearly fell into the trap and told a story of a bicyclist hurrying past in the grey dawn
but i had the sense to see my danger
i pretended to consider very deeply
i wasna up very early i said
ye see my dochter was merrit last nicht and we keepit it up late
i opened the house door about seeven and there was naebody on the road then
since i cam up here there has just been the baker and the ruchill herd besides you gentlemen  one of them gave me a cigar which i smelt gingerly and stuck in turnbulls bundle
they got into their car and were out of sight in three minutes
my heart leaped with an enormous relief but i went on wheeling my stones
it was as well for ten minutes later the car returned one of the occupants waving a hand to me
those gentry left nothing to chance
i finished turnbulls bread and cheese and pretty soon i had finished the stones
the next step was what puzzled me
i could not keep up this roadmaking business for long
a merciful providence had kept mr turnbull indoors but if he appeared on the scene there would be trouble
i had a notion that the cordon was still tight round the glen and that if i walked in any direction i should meet with questioners
but get out i must
no mans nerve could stand more than a day of being spied on
i stayed at my post till five oclock
by that time i had resolved to go down to turnbulls cottage at nightfall and take my chance of getting over the hills in the darkness
but suddenly a new car came up the road and slowed down a yard or two from me
a fresh wind had risen and the occupant wanted to light a cigarette
it was a touring car with the tonneau full of an assortment of baggage
one man sat in it and by an amazing chance i knew him
his name was marmaduke jopley and he was an offence to creation
he was a sort of blood stockbroker who did his business by toadying eldest sons and rich young peers and foolish old ladies
marmie was a familiar figure i understood at balls and poloweeks and country houses
he was an adroit scandalmonger and would crawl a mile on his belly to anything that had a title or a million
i had a business introduction to his firm when i came to london and he was good enough to ask me to dinner at his club
there he showed off at a great rate and pattered about his duchesses till the snobbery of the creature turned me sick
i asked a man afterwards why nobody kicked him and was told that englishmen reverenced the weaker sex
anyhow there he was now nattily dressed in a fine new car obviously on his way to visit some of his smart friends
a sudden daftness took me and in a second i had jumped into the tonneau and had him by the shoulder
hullo jopley i sang out
well met my lad he got a horrid fright
his chin dropped as he stared at me
who the devil are you he gasped
my names hannay i said
from rhodesia you remember  good god the murderer he choked
just so
and therell be a second murder my dear if you dont do as i tell you
give me that coat of yours
that cap too  he did as he was bid for he was blind with terror
over my dirty trousers and vulgar shirt i put on his smart drivingcoat which buttoned high at the top and thereby hid the deficiencies of my collar
i stuck the cap on my head and added his gloves to my getup
the dusty roadman in a minute was transformed into one of the neatest motorists in scotland
on mr jopleys head i clapped turnbulls unspeakable hat and told him to keep it there
then with some difficulty i turned the car
my plan was to go back the road he had come for the watchers having seen it before would probably let it pass unremarked and marmies figure was in no way like mine
now my child i said sit quite still and be a good boy
i mean you no harm
im only borrowing your car for an hour or two
but if you play me any tricks and above all if you open your mouth as sure as theres a god above me ill wring your neck
savez  i enjoyed that evenings ride
we ran eight miles down the valley through a village or two and i could not help noticing several strangelooking folk lounging by the roadside
these were the watchers who would have had much to say to me if i had come in other garb or company
as it was they looked incuriously on
one touched his cap in salute and i responded graciously
as the dark fell i turned up a side glen which as i remember from the map led into an unfrequented corner of the hills
soon the villages were left behind then the farms and then even the wayside cottage
presently we came to a lonely moor where the night was blackening the sunset gleam in the bog pools
here we stopped and i obligingly reversed the car and restored to mr jopley his belongings
a thousand thanks i said
theres more use in you than i thought
now be off and find the police  as i sat on the hillside watching the taillight dwindle i reflected on the various kinds of crime i had now sampled
contrary to general belief i was not a murderer but i had become an unholy liar a shameless impostor and a highwayman with a marked taste for expensive motorcars
chapter vi
the adventure of the bald archaeologist   i spent the night on a shelf of the hillside in the lee of a boulder where the heather grew long and soft
it was a cold business for i had neither coat nor waistcoat
these were in mr turnbulls keeping as was scudders little book my watch andworst of allmy pipe and tobacco pouch
only my money accompanied me in my belt and about half a pound of ginger biscuits in my trousers pocket
i supped off half those biscuits and by worming myself deep into the heather got some kind of warmth
my spirits had risen and i was beginning to enjoy this crazy game of hideandseek
so far i had been miraculously lucky
the milkman the literary innkeeper sir harry the roadman and the idiotic marmie were all pieces of undeserved good fortune
somehow the first success gave me a feeling that i was going to pull the thing through
my chief trouble was that i was desperately hungry
when a jew shoots himself in the city and there is an inquest the newspapers usually report that the deceased was wellnourished
i remember thinking that they would not call me wellnourished if i broke my neck in a boghole
i lay and tortured myselffor the ginger biscuits merely emphasized the aching voidwith the memory of all the good food i had thought so little of in london
there were paddocks crisp sausages and fragrant shavings of bacon and shapely poached eggshow often i had turned up my nose at them
there were the cutlets they did at the club and a particular ham that stood on the cold table for which my soul lusted
my thoughts hovered over all varieties of mortal edible and finally settled on a porterhouse steak and a quart of bitter with a welsh rabbit to follow
in longing hopelessly for these dainties i fell asleep
i woke very cold and stiff about an hour after dawn
it took me a little while to remember where i was for i had been very weary and had slept heavily
i saw first the pale blue sky through a net of heather then a big shoulder of hill and then my own boots placed neatly in a blaeberry bush
i raised myself on my arms and looked down into the valley and that one look set me lacing up my boots in mad haste
for there were men below not more than a quarter of a mile off spaced out on the hillside like a fan and beating the heather
marmie had not been slow in looking for his revenge
i crawled out of my shelf into the cover of a boulder and from it gained a shallow trench which slanted up the mountain face
this led me presently into the narrow gully of a burn by way of which i scrambled to the top of the ridge
from there i looked back and saw that i was still undiscovered
my pursuers were patiently quartering the hillside and moving upwards
keeping behind the skyline i ran for maybe half a mile till i judged i was above the uppermost end of the glen
then i showed myself and was instantly noted by one of the flankers who passed the word to the others
i heard cries coming up from below and saw that the line of search had changed its direction
i pretended to retreat over the skyline but instead went back the way i had come and in twenty minutes was behind the ridge overlooking my sleeping place
from that viewpoint i had the satisfaction of seeing the pursuit streaming up the hill at the top of the glen on a hopelessly false scent
i had before me a choice of routes and i chose a ridge which made an angle with the one i was on and so would soon put a deep glen between me and my enemies
the exercise had warmed my blood and i was beginning to enjoy myself amazingly
as i went i breakfasted on the dusty remnants of the ginger biscuits
i knew very little about the country and i hadnt a notion what i was going to do
i trusted to the strength of my legs but i was well aware that those behind me would be familiar with the lie of the land and that my ignorance would be a heavy handicap
i saw in front of me a sea of hills rising very high towards the south but northwards breaking down into broad ridges which separated wide and shallow dales
the ridge i had chosen seemed to sink after a mile or two to a moor which lay like a pocket in the uplands
that seemed as good a direction to take as any other
my stratagem had given me a fair startcall it twenty minutesand i had the width of a glen behind me before i saw the first heads of the pursuers
the police had evidently called in local talent to their aid and the men i could see had the appearance of herds or gamekeepers
they hallooed at the sight of me and i waved my hand
two dived into the glen and began to climb my ridge while the others kept their own side of the hill
i felt as if i were taking part in a schoolboy game of hare and hounds
but very soon it began to seem less of a game
those fellows behind were hefty men on their native heath
looking back i saw that only three were following direct and i guessed that the others had fetched a circuit to cut me off
my lack of local knowledge might very well be my undoing and i resolved to get out of this tangle of glens to the pocket of moor i had seen from the tops
i must so increase my distance as to get clear away from them and i believed i could do this if i could find the right ground for it
if there had been cover i would have tried a bit of stalking but on these bare slopes you could see a fly a mile off
my hope must be in the length of my legs and the soundness of my wind but i needed easier ground for that for i was not bred a mountaineer
how i longed for a good afrikander pony
i put on a great spurt and got off my ridge and down into the moor before any figures appeared on the skyline behind me
i crossed a burn and came out on a highroad which made a pass between two glens
all in front of me was a big field of heather sloping up to a crest which was crowned with an odd feather of trees
in the dyke by the roadside was a gate from which a grassgrown track led over the first wave of the moor
i jumped the dyke and followed it and after a few hundred yardsas soon as it was out of sight of the highwaythe grass stopped and it became a very respectable road which was evidently kept with some care
clearly it ran to a house and i began to think of doing the same
hitherto my luck had held and it might be that my best chance would be found in this remote dwelling
anyhow there were trees there and that meant cover
i did not follow the road but the burnside which flanked it on the right where the bracken grew deep and the high banks made a tolerable screen
it was well i did so for no sooner had i gained the hollow than looking back i saw the pursuit topping the ridge from which i had descended
after that i did not look back i had no time
i ran up the burnside crawling over the open places and for a large part wading in the shallow stream
i found a deserted cottage with a row of phantom peatstacks and an overgrown garden
then i was among young hay and very soon had come to the edge of a plantation of windblown firs
from there i saw the chimneys of the house smoking a few hundred yards to my left
i forsook the burnside crossed another dyke and almost before i knew was on a rough lawn
a glance back told me that i was well out of sight of the pursuit which had not yet passed the first lift of the moor
the lawn was a very rough place cut with a scythe instead of a mower and planted with beds of scrubby rhododendrons
a brace of blackgame which are not usually garden birds rose at my approach
the house before me was the ordinary moorland farm with a more pretentious whitewashed wing added
attached to this wing was a glass veranda and through the glass i saw the face of an elderly gentleman meekly watching me
i stalked over the border of coarse hill gravel and entered the open veranda door
within was a pleasant room glass on one side and on the other a mass of books
more books showed in an inner room
on the floor instead of tables stood cases such as you see in a museum filled with coins and queer stone implements
there was a kneehole desk in the middle and seated at it with some papers and open volumes before him was the benevolent old gentleman
his face was round and shiny like mr pickwicks big glasses were stuck on the end of his nose and the top of his head was as bright and bare as a glass bottle
he never moved when i entered but raised his placid eyebrows and waited on me to speak
it was not an easy job with about five minutes to spare to tell a stranger who i was and what i wanted and to win his aid
i did not attempt it
there was something about the eye of the man before me something so keen and knowledgeable that i could not find a word
i simply stared at him and stuttered
you seem in a hurry my friend he said slowly
i nodded towards the window
it gave a prospect across the moor through a gap in the plantation and revealed certain figures half a mile off straggling through the heather
ah i see he said and took up a pair of fieldglasses through which he patiently scrutinized the figures
a fugitive from justice eh
well well go into the matter at our leisure
meantime i object to my privacy being broken in upon by the clumsy rural policeman
go into my study and you will see two doors facing you
take the one on the left and close it behind you
you will be perfectly safe  and this extraordinary man took up his pen again
i did as i was bid and found myself in a little dark chamber which smelt of chemicals and was lit only by a tiny window high up in the wall
the door had swung behind me with a click like the door of a safe
once again i had found an unexpected sanctuary
all the same i was not comfortable
there was something about the old gentleman which puzzled and rather terrified me
he had been too easy and ready almost as if he had expected me
and his eyes had been horribly intelligent
no sound came to me in that dark place
for all i knew the police might be searching the house and if they did they would want to know what was behind this door
i tried to possess my soul in patience and to forget how hungry i was
then i took a more cheerful view
the old gentleman could scarcely refuse me a meal and i fell to reconstructing my breakfast
bacon and eggs would content me but i wanted the better part of a flitch of bacon and half a hundred eggs
and then while my mouth was watering in anticipation there was a click and the door stood open
i emerged into the sunlight to find the master of the house sitting in a deep armchair in the room he called his study and regarding me with curious eyes
have they gone i asked
they have gone
i convinced them that you had crossed the hill
i do not choose that the police should come between me and one whom i am delighted to honour
this is a lucky morning for you mr richard hannay  as he spoke his eyelids seemed to tremble and to fall a little over his keen grey eyes
in a flash the phrase of scudders came back to me when he had described the man he most dreaded in the world
he had said that he could hood his eyes like a hawk
then i saw that i had walked straight into the enemys headquarters
my first impulse was to throttle the old ruffian and make for the open air
he seemed to anticipate my intention for he smiled gently and nodded to the door behind me
i turned and saw two menservants who had me covered with pistols
he knew my name but he had never seen me before
and as the reflection darted across my mind i saw a slender chance
i dont know what you mean i said roughly
and who are you calling richard hannay
my names ainslie  so he said still smiling
but of course you have others
we wont quarrel about a name  i was pulling myself together now and i reflected that my garb lacking coat and waistcoat and collar would at any rate not betray me
i put on my surliest face and shrugged my shoulders
i suppose youre going to give me up after all and i call it a damned dirty trick
my god i wish i had never seen that cursed motorcar
heres the money and be damned to you and i flung four sovereigns on the table
he opened his eyes a little
oh no i shall not give you up
my friends and i will have a little private settlement with you that is all
you know a little too much mr hannay
you are a clever actor but not quite clever enough  he spoke with assurance but i could see the dawning of a doubt in his mind
oh for gods sake stop jawing i cried
everythings against me
i havent had a bit of luck since i came on shore at leith
whats the harm in a poor devil with an empty stomach picking up some money he finds in a bustup motorcar
thats all i done and for that ive been chivvied for two days by those blasted bobbies over those blasted hills
i tell you im fair sick of it
you can do what you like old boy
ned ainslies got no fight left in him  i could see that the doubt was gaining
will you oblige me with the story of your recent doings he asked
i cant guvnor i said in a real beggars whine
ive not had a bite to eat for two days
give me a mouthful of food and then youll hear gods truth  i must have showed my hunger in my face for he signalled to one of the men in the doorway
a bit of cold pie was brought and a glass of beer and i wolfed them down like a pigor rather like ned ainslie for i was keeping up my character
in the middle of my meal he spoke suddenly to me in german but i turned on him a face as blank as a stone wall
then i told him my storyhow i had come off an archangel ship at leith a week ago and was making my way overland to my brother at wigtown
i had run short of cashi hinted vaguely at a spreeand i was pretty well on my uppers when i had come on a hole in a hedge and looking through had seen a big motorcar lying in the burn
i had poked about to see what had happened and had found three sovereigns lying on the seat and one on the floor
there was nobody there or any sign of an owner so i had pocketed the cash
but somehow the law had got after me
when i had tried to change a sovereign in a bakers shop the woman had cried on the police and a little later when i was washing my face in a burn i had been nearly gripped and had only got away by leaving my coat and waistcoat behind me
they can have the money back i cried for a fat lot of good its done me
those perishers are all down on a poor man
now if it had been you guvnor that had found the quids nobody would have troubled you  youre a good liar hannay he said
i flew into a rage
stop fooling damn you
i tell you my names ainslie and i never heard of anyone called hannay in my born days
id sooner have the police than you with your hannays and your monkeyfaced pistol tricks no guvnor i beg pardon i dont mean that
im much obliged to you for the grub and ill thank you to let me go now the coasts clear  it was obvious that he was badly puzzled
you see he had never seen me and my appearance must have altered considerably from my photographs if he had got one of them
i was pretty smart and well dressed in london and now i was a regular tramp
i do not propose to let you go
if you are what you say you are you will soon have a chance of clearing yourself
if you are what i believe you are i do not think you will see the light much longer  he rang a bell and a third servant appeared from the veranda
i want the lanchester in five minutes he said
there will be three to luncheon  then he looked steadily at me and that was the hardest ordeal of all
there was something weird and devilish in those eyes cold malignant unearthly and most hellishly clever
they fascinated me like the bright eyes of a snake
i had a strong impulse to throw myself on his mercy and offer to join his side and if you consider the way i felt about the whole thing you will see that that impulse must have been purely physical the weakness of a brain mesmerized and mastered by a stronger spirit
but i managed to stick it out and even to grin
youll know me next time guvnor i said
karl he spoke in german to one of the men in the doorway you will put this fellow in the storeroom till i return and you will be answerable to me for his keeping  i was marched out of the room with a pistol at each ear
the storeroom was a damp chamber in what had been the old farmhouse
there was no carpet on the uneven floor and nothing to sit down on but a school form
it was black as pitch for the windows were heavily shuttered
i made out by groping that the walls were lined with boxes and barrels and sacks of some heavy stuff
the whole place smelt of mould and disuse
my gaolers turned the key in the door and i could hear them shifting their feet as they stood on guard outside
i sat down in that chilly darkness in a very miserable frame of mind
the old boy had gone off in a motor to collect the two ruffians who had interviewed me yesterday
now they had seen me as the roadman and they would remember me for i was in the same rig
what was a roadman doing twenty miles from his beat pursued by the police
a question or two would put them on the track
probably they had seen mr turnbull probably marmie too most likely they could link me up with sir harry and then the whole thing would be crystal clear
what chance had i in this moorland house with three desperadoes and their armed servants
i began to think wistfully of the police now plodding over the hills after my wraith
they at any rate were fellowcountrymen and honest men and their tender mercies would be kinder than these ghoulish aliens
but they wouldnt have listened to me
that old devil with the eyelids had not taken long to get rid of them
i thought he probably had some kind of graft with the constabulary
most likely he had letters from cabinet ministers saying he was to be given every facility for plotting against britain
thats the sort of owlish way we run our politics in this jolly old country
the three would be back for lunch so i hadnt more than a couple of hours to wait
it was simply waiting on destruction for i could see no way out of this mess
i wished that i had scudders courage for i am free to confess i didnt feel any great fortitude
the only thing that kept me going was that i was pretty furious
it made me boil with rage to think of those three spies getting the pull on me like this
i hoped that at any rate i might be able to twist one of their necks before they downed me
the more i thought of it the angrier i grew and i had to get up and move about the room
i tried the shutters but they were the kind that lock with a key and i couldnt move them
from the outside came the faint clucking of hens in the warm sun
then i groped among the sacks and boxes
i couldnt open the latter and the sacks seemed to be full of things like dogbiscuits that smelt of cinnamon
but as i circumnavigated the room i found a handle in the wall which seemed worth investigating
it was the door of a wall cupboardwhat they call a press in scotlandand it was locked
i shook it and it seemed rather flimsy
for want of something better to do i put out my strength on that door getting some purchase on the handle by looping my braces round it
presently the thing gave with a crash which i thought would bring in my warders to inquire
i waited for a bit and then started to explore the cupboard shelves
there was a multitude of queer things there
i found an odd vesta or two in my trouser pockets and struck a light
it was out in a second but it showed me one thing
there was a little stock of electric torches on one shelf
i picked up one and found it was in working order
with the torch to help me i investigated further
there were bottles and cases of queersmelling stuffs chemicals no doubt for experiments and there were coils of fine copper wire and yanks and yanks of thin oiled silk
there was a box of detonators and a lot of cord for fuses
then away at the back of the shelf i found a stout brown cardboard box and inside it a wooden case
i managed to wrench it open and within lay half a dozen little grey bricks each a couple of inches square
i took up one and found that it crumbled easily in my hand
then i smelt it and put my tongue to it
after that i sat down to think
i hadnt been a mining engineer for nothing and i knew lentonite when i saw it
with one of these bricks i could blow the house to smithereens
i had used the stuff in rhodesia and knew its power
but the trouble was that my knowledge wasnt exact
i had forgotten the proper charge and the right way of preparing it and i wasnt sure about the timing
i had only a vague notion too as to its power for though i had used it i had not handled it with my own fingers
but it was a chance the only possible chance
it was a mighty risk but against it was an absolute black certainty
if i used it the odds were as i reckoned about five to one in favour of my blowing myself into the treetops but if i didnt i should very likely be occupying a sixfoot hole in the garden by the evening
that was the way i had to look at it
the prospect was pretty dark either way but anyhow there was a chance both for myself and for my country
the remembrance of little scudder decided me
it was about the beastliest moment of my life for im no good at these coldblooded resolutions
still i managed to rake up the pluck to set my teeth and choke back the horrid doubts that flooded in on me
i simply shut off my mind and pretended i was doing an experiment as simple as guy fawkes fireworks
i got a detonator and fixed it to a couple of feet of fuse
then i took a quarter of a lentonite brick and buried it near the door below one of the sacks in a crack of the floor fixing the detonator in it
for all i knew half those boxes might be dynamite
if the cupboard held such deadly explosives why not the boxes
in that case there would be a glorious skyward journey for me and the german servants and about an acre of surrounding country
there was also the risk that the detonation might set off the other bricks in the cupboard for i had forgotten most that i knew about lentonite
but it didnt do to begin thinking about the possibilities
the odds were horrible but i had to take them
i ensconced myself just below the sill of the window and lit the fuse
then i waited for a moment or two
there was dead silenceonly a shuffle of heavy boots in the passage and the peaceful cluck of hens from the warm outofdoors
i commended my soul to my maker and wondered where i would be in five seconds  a great wave of heat seemed to surge upwards from the floor and hang for a blistering instant in the air
then the wall opposite me flashed into a golden yellow and dissolved with a rending thunder that hammered my brain into a pulp
something dropped on me catching the point of my left shoulder
and then i think i became unconscious
my stupor can scarcely have lasted beyond a few seconds
i felt myself being choked by thick yellow fumes and struggled out of the debris to my feet
somewhere behind me i felt fresh air
the jambs of the window had fallen and through the ragged rent the smoke was pouring out to the summer noon
i stepped over the broken lintel and found myself standing in a yard in a dense and acrid fog
i felt very sick and ill but i could move my limbs and i staggered blindly forward away from the house
a small milllade ran in a wooden aqueduct at the other side of the yard and into this i fell
the cool water revived me and i had just enough wits left to think of escape
i squirmed up the lade among the slippery green slime till i reached the millwheel
then i wriggled through the axle hole into the old mill and tumbled on to a bed of chaff
a nail caught the seat of my trousers and i left a wisp of heathermixture behind me
the mill had been long out of use
the ladders were rotten with age and in the loft the rats had gnawed great holes in the floor
nausea shook me and a wheel in my head kept turning while my left shoulder and arm seemed to be stricken with the palsy
i looked out of the window and saw a fog still hanging over the house and smoke escaping from an upper window
please god i had set the place on fire for i could hear confused cries coming from the other side
but i had no time to linger since this mill was obviously a bad hidingplace
anyone looking for me would naturally follow the lade and i made certain the search would begin as soon as they found that my body was not in the storeroom
from another window i saw that on the far side of the mill stood an old stone dovecot
if i could get there without leaving tracks i might find a hidingplace for i argued that my enemies if they thought i could move would conclude i had made for open country and would go seeking me on the moor
i crawled down the broken ladder scattering chaff behind me to cover my footsteps
i did the same on the mill floor and on the threshold where the door hung on broken hinges
peeping out i saw that between me and the dovecot was a piece of bare cobbled ground where no footmarks would show
also it was mercifully hid by the mill buildings from any view from the house
i slipped across the space got to the back of the dovecot and prospected a way of ascent
that was one of the hardest jobs i ever took on
my shoulder and arm ached like hell and i was so sick and giddy that i was always on the verge of falling
but i managed it somehow
by the use of outjutting stones and gaps in the masonry and a tough ivy root i got to the top in the end
there was a little parapet behind which i found space to lie down
then i proceeded to go off into an oldfashioned swoon
i woke with a burning head and the sun glaring in my face
for a long time i lay motionless for those horrible fumes seemed to have loosened my joints and dulled my brain
sounds came to me from the housemen speaking throatily and the throbbing of a stationary car
there was a little gap in the parapet to which i wriggled and from which i had some sort of prospect of the yard
i saw figures come outa servant with his head bound up and then a younger man in knickerbockers
they were looking for something and moved towards the mill
then one of them caught sight of the wisp of cloth on the nail and cried out to the other
they both went back to the house and brought two more to look at it
i saw the rotund figure of my late captor and i thought i made out the man with the lisp
i noticed that all had pistols
for half an hour they ransacked the mill
i could hear them kicking over the barrels and pulling up the rotten planking
then they came outside and stood just below the dovecot arguing fiercely
the servant with the bandage was being soundly rated
i heard them fiddling with the door of the dovecote and for one horrid moment i fancied they were coming up
then they thought better of it and went back to the house
all that long blistering afternoon i lay baking on the rooftop
thirst was my chief torment
my tongue was like a stick and to make it worse i could hear the cool drip of water from the milllade
i watched the course of the little stream as it came in from the moor and my fancy followed it to the top of the glen where it must issue from an icy fountain fringed with cool ferns and mosses
i would have given a thousand pounds to plunge my face into that
i had a fine prospect of the whole ring of moorland
i saw the car speed away with two occupants and a man on a hill pony riding east
i judged they were looking for me and i wished them joy of their quest
but i saw something else more interesting
the house stood almost on the summit of a swell of moorland which crowned a sort of plateau and there was no higher point nearer than the big hills six miles off
the actual summit as i have mentioned was a biggish clump of treesfirs mostly with a few ashes and beeches
on the dovecot i was almost on a level with the treetops and could see what lay beyond
the wood was not solid but only a ring and inside was an oval of green turf for all the world like a big cricketfield
i didnt take long to guess what it was
it was an aerodrome and a secret one
the place had been most cunningly chosen
for suppose anyone were watching an aeroplane descending here he would think it had gone over the hill beyond the trees
as the place was on the top of a rise in the midst of a big amphitheatre any observer from any direction would conclude it had passed out of view behind the hill
only a man very close at hand would realize that the aeroplane had not gone over but had descended in the midst of the wood
an observer with a telescope on one of the higher hills might have discovered the truth but only herds went there and herds do not carry spyglasses
when i looked from the dovecot i could see far away a blue line which i knew was the sea and i grew furious to think that our enemies had this secret conningtower to rake our waterways
then i reflected that if that aeroplane came back the chances were ten to one that i would be discovered
so through the afternoon i lay and prayed for the coming of darkness and glad i was when the sun went down over the big western hills and the twilight haze crept over the moor
the aeroplane was late
the gloaming was far advanced when i heard the beat of wings and saw it volplaning downward to its home in the wood
lights twinkled for a bit and there was much coming and going from the house
then the dark fell and silence
thank god it was a black night
the moon was well on its last quarter and would not rise till late
my thirst was too great to allow me to tarry so about nine oclock so far as i could judge i started to descend
it wasnt easy and halfway down i heard the back door of the house open and saw the gleam of a lantern against the mill wall
for some agonizing minutes i hung by the ivy and prayed that whoever it was would not come round by the dovecot
then the light disappeared and i dropped as softly as i could on to the hard soil of the yard
i crawled on my belly in the lee of a stone dyke till i reached the fringe of trees which surrounded the house
if i had known how to do it i would have tried to put that aeroplane out of action but i realized that any attempt would probably be futile
i was pretty certain that there would be some kind of defence round the house so i went through the wood on hands and knees feeling carefully every inch before me
it was as well for presently i came on a wire about two feet from the ground
if i had tripped over that it would doubtless have rung some bell in the house and i would have been captured
a hundred yards farther on i found another wire cunningly placed on the edge of a small stream
beyond that lay the moor and in five minutes i was deep in bracken and heather
soon i was round the shoulder of the rise in the little glen from which the milllade flowed
ten minutes later my face was in the spring and i was soaking down pints of the blessed water
but i did not stop till i had put half a dozen miles between me and that accursed dwelling
chapter vii
the dryfly fisherman   i sat down on a hilltop and took stock of my position
i wasnt feeling very happy for my natural thankfulness at my escape was clouded by my severe bodily discomfort
those lentonite fumes had fairly poisoned me and the baking hours on the dovecot hadnt helped matters
i had a crushing headache and felt as sick as a cat
also my shoulder was in a bad way
at first i thought it was only a bruise but it seemed to be swelling and i had no use of my left arm
my plan was to seek mr turnbulls cottage recover my garments and especially scudders notebook and then make for the main line and get back to the south
it seemed to me that the sooner i got in touch with the foreign office man sir walter bullivant the better
i didnt see how i could get more proof than i had got already
he must just take or leave my story and anyway with him i would be in better hands than those devilish germans
i had begun to feel quite kindly towards the british police
it was a wonderful starry night and i had not much difficulty about the road
sir harrys map had given me the lie of the land and all i had to do was to steer a point or two west of southwest to come to the stream where i had met the roadman
in all these travels i never knew the names of the places but i believe this stream was no less than the upper waters of the river tweed
i calculated i must be about eighteen miles distant and that meant i could not get there before morning
so i must lie up a day somewhere for i was too outrageous a figure to be seen in the sunlight
i had neither coat waistcoat collar nor hat my trousers were badly torn and my face and hands were black with the explosion
i daresay i had other beauties for my eyes felt as if they were furiously bloodshot
altogether i was no spectacle for godfearing citizens to see on a highroad
very soon after daybreak i made an attempt to clean myself in a hill burn and then approached a herds cottage for i was feeling the need of food
the herd was away from home and his wife was alone with no neighbour for five miles
she was a decent old body and a plucky one for though she got a fright when she saw me she had an axe handy and would have used it on any evildoer
i told her that i had had a falli didnt say howand she saw by my looks that i was pretty sick
like a true samaritan she asked no questions but gave me a bowl of milk with a dash of whisky in it and let me sit for a little by her kitchen fire
she would have bathed my shoulder but it ached so badly that i would not let her touch it
i dont know what she took me fora repentant burglar perhaps for when i wanted to pay her for the milk and tendered a sovereign which was the smallest coin i had she shook her head and said something about giving it to them that had a right to it
at this i protested so strongly that i think she believed me honest for she took the money and gave me a warm new plaid for it and an old hat of her mans
she showed me how to wrap the plaid around my shoulders and when i left that cottage i was the living image of the kind of scotsman you see in the illustrations to burnss poems
but at any rate i was more or less clad
it was as well for the weather changed before midday to a thick drizzle of rain
i found shelter below an overhanging rock in the crook of a burn where a drift of dead brackens made a tolerable bed
there i managed to sleep till nightfall waking very cramped and wretched with my shoulder gnawing like a toothache
i ate the oatcake and cheese the old wife had given me and set out again just before the darkening
i pass over the miseries of that night among the wet hills
there were no stars to steer by and i had to do the best i could from my memory of the map
twice i lost my way and i had some nasty falls into peatbogs
i had only about ten miles to go as the crow flies but my mistakes made it nearer twenty
the last bit was completed with set teeth and a very light and dizzy head
but i managed it and in the early dawn i was knocking at mr turnbulls door
the mist lay close and thick and from the cottage i could not see the highroad
mr turnbull himself opened to mesober and something more than sober
he was primly dressed in an ancient but welltended suit of black he had been shaved not later than the night before he wore a linen collar and in his left hand he carried a pocket bible
at first he did not recognize me
whae are ye that comes stravaigin here on the sabbath mornin he asked
i had lost all count of the days
so the sabbath was the reason for this strange decorum
my head was swimming so wildly that i could not frame a coherent answer
but he recognized me and he saw that i was ill  hae ye got my specs he asked
i fetched them out of my trouser pocket and gave him them
yell hae come for your jaicket and westcoat he said
come inbye
losh man yere terrible dune i the legs
haud up till i get ye to a chair  i perceived i was in for a bout of malaria
i had a good deal of fever in my bones and the wet night had brought it out while my shoulder and the effects of the fumes combined to make me feel pretty bad
before i knew mr turnbull was helping me off with my clothes and putting me to bed in one of the two cupboards that lined the kitchen walls
he was a true friend in need that old roadman
his wife was dead years ago and since his daughters marriage he lived alone
for the better part of ten days he did all the rough nursing i needed
i simply wanted to be left in peace while the fever took its course and when my skin was cool again i found that the bout had more or less cured my shoulder
but it was a baddish go and though i was out of bed in five days it took me some time to get my legs again
he went out each morning leaving me milk for the day and locking the door behind him and came in in the evening to sit silent in the chimney corner
not a soul came near the place
when i was getting better he never bothered me with a question
several times he fetched me a two days old scotsman and i noticed that the interest in the portland place murder seemed to have died down
there was no mention of it and i could find very little about anything except a thing called the general assemblysome ecclesiastical spree i gathered
one day he produced my belt from a lockfast drawer
theres a terrible heap o siller int he said
yed better coont it to see its a there  he never even sought my name
i asked him if anybody had been around making inquiries subsequent to my spell at the roadmaking
ay there was a man in a motorcawr
he speired whae had taen my place that day and i let on i thocht him daft
but he keepit on at me and syne i said he maun be thinkin o my gudebrither frae the cleuch that whiles lent me a haun
he was a wershlookin sowl and i couldna understand the half o his english tongue  i was getting restless those last days and as soon as i felt myself fit i decided to be off
that was not till the twelfth day of june and as luck would have it a drover went past that morning taking some cattle to moffat
he was a man named hislop a friend of turnbulls and he came in to his breakfast with us and offered to take me with him
i made turnbull accept five pounds for my lodging and a hard job i had of it
there never was a more independent being
he grew positively rude when i pressed him and shy and red and took the money at last without a thank you
when i told him how much i owed him he grunted something about ae guid turn deservin anitherv you would have thought from our leavetaking that we had parted in disgust
hislop was a cheery soul who chattered all the way over the pass and down the sunny vale of annan
i talked of galloway markets and sheep prices and he made up his mind i was a packshepherd from those partswhatever that may be
my plaid and my old hat as i have said gave me a fine theatrical scots look
but driving cattle is a mortally slow job and we took the better part of the day to cover a dozen miles
if i had not had such an anxious heart i would have enjoyed that time
it was shining blue weather with a constantly changing prospect of brown hills and far green meadows and a continual sound of larks and curlews and falling streams
but i had no mind for the summer and little for hislops conversation for as the fateful fifteenth of june drew near i was overweighed with the hopeless difficulties of my enterprise
i got some dinner in a humble moffat publichouse and walked the two miles to the junction on the main line
the night express for the south was not due till near midnight and to fill up the time i went up on the hillside and fell asleep for the walk had tired me
i all but slept too long and had to run to the station and catch the train with two minutes to spare
the feel of the hard thirdclass cushions and the smell of stale tobacco cheered me up wonderfully
at any rate i felt now that i was getting to grips with my job
i was decanted at crewe in the small hours and had to wait till six to get a train for birmingham
in the afternoon i got to reading and changed into a local train which journeyed into the deeps of berkshire
presently i was in a land of lush watermeadows and slow reedy streams
about eight oclock in the evening a weary and travelstained beinga cross between a farmlabourer and a vetwith a checked blackandwhite plaid over his arm for i did not dare to wear it south of the border descended at the little station of artinswell
there were several people on the platform and i thought i had better wait to ask my way till i was clear of the place
the road led through a wood of great beeches and then into a shallow valley with the green backs of downs peeping over the distant trees
after scotland the air smelt heavy and flat but infinitely sweet for the limes and chestnuts and lilac bushes were domes of blossom
presently i came to a bridge below which a clear slow stream flowed between snowy beds of waterbuttercups
a little above it was a mill and the lasher made a pleasant cool sound in the scented dusk
somehow the place soothed me and put me at my ease
i fell to whistling as i looked into the green depths and the tune which came to my lips was annie laurie
a fisherman came up from the waterside and as he neared me he too began to whistle
the tune was infectious for he followed my suit
he was a huge man in untidy old flannels and a widebrimmed hat with a canvas bag slung on his shoulder
he nodded to me and i thought i had never seen a shrewder or bettertempered face
he leaned his delicate tenfoot splitcane rod against the bridge and looked with me at the water
clear isnt it he said pleasantly
i back our kennet any day against the test
look at that big fellow
four pounds if hes an ounce
but the evening rise is over and you cant tempt em  i dont see him said i
look
there
a yard from the reeds just above that stickle  ive got him now
you might swear he was a black stone  so he said and whistled another bar of annie laurie
twisdons the name isnt it he said over his shoulder his eyes still fixed on the stream
no i said
i mean to say yes i had forgotten all about my alias
its a wise conspirator that knows his own name he observed grinning broadly at a moorhen that emerged from the bridges shadow
i stood up and looked at him at the square cleft jaw and broad lined brow and the firm folds of cheek and began to think that here at last was an ally worth having
his whimsical blue eyes seemed to go very deep
suddenly he frowned
i call it disgraceful he said raising his voice
disgraceful that an ablebodied man like you should dare to beg
you can get a meal from my kitchen but youll get no money from me  a dogcart was passing driven by a young man who raised his whip to salute the fisherman
when he had gone he picked up his rod
thats my house he said pointing to a white gate a hundred yards on
wait five minutes and then go round to the back door and with that he left me
i did as i was bidden
i found a pretty cottage with a lawn running down to the stream and a perfect jungle of guelderrose and lilac flanking the path
the back door stood open and a grave butler was awaiting me
come this way sir he said and he led me along a passage and up a back staircase to a pleasant bedroom looking towards the river
there i found a complete outfit laid out for medress clothes with all the fixings a brown flannel suit shirts collars ties shaving things and hairbrushes even a pair of patent shoes
sir walter thought as how mr reggies things would fit you sir said the butler
he keeps some clothes ere for he comes regular on the weekends
theres a bathroom next door and ive prepared a ot bath
dinner in alf an hour sir
youll ear the gong  the grave being withdrew and i sat down in a chintzcovered easychair and gaped
it was like a pantomime to come suddenly out of beggardom into this orderly comfort
obviously sir walter believed in me though why he did i could not guess
i looked at myself in the mirror and saw a wild haggard brown fellow with a fortnights ragged beard and dust in ears and eyes collarless vulgarly shirted with shapeless old tweed clothes and boots that had not been cleaned for the better part of a month
i made a fine tramp and a fair drover and here i was ushered by a prim butler into this temple of gracious ease
and the best of it was that they did not even know my name
i resolved not to puzzle my head but to take the gifts the gods had provided
i shaved and bathed luxuriously and got into the dress clothes and clean crackling shirt which fitted me not so badly
by the time i had finished the lookingglass showed a not unpersonable young man
sir walter awaited me in a dusky diningroom where a little round table was lit with silver candles
the sight of himso respectable and established and secure the embodiment of law and government and all the conventionstook me aback and made me feel an interloper
he couldnt know the truth about me or he wouldnt treat me like this
i simply could not accept his hospitality on false pretences
im more obliged to you than i can say but im bound to make things clear i said
im an innocent man but im wanted by the police
ive got to tell you this and i wont be surprised if you kick me out  he smiled
thats all right
dont let that interfere with your appetite
we can talk about these things after dinner i never ate a meal with greater relish for i had had nothing all day but railway sandwiches
sir walter did me proud for we drank a good champagne and had some uncommon fine port afterwards
it made me almost hysterical to be sitting there waited on by a footman and a sleek butler and remember that i had been living for three weeks like a brigand with every mans hand against me
i told sir walter about tigerfish in the zambesi that bite off your fingers if you give them a chance and we discussed sport up and down the globe for he had hunted a bit in his day
we went to his study for coffee a jolly room full of books and trophies and untidiness and comfort
i made up my mind that if ever i got rid of this business and had a house of my own i would create just such a room
then when the coffeecups were cleared away and we had got our cigars alight my host swung his long legs over the side of his chair and bade me get started with my yarn
ive obeyed harrys instructions he said and the bribe he offered me was that you would tell me something to wake me up
im ready mr hannay  i noticed with a start that he called me by my proper name
i began at the very beginning
i told of my boredom in london and the night i had come back to find scudder gibbering on my doorstep
i told him all scudder had told me about karolides and the foreign office conference and that made him purse his lips and grin
then i got to the murder and he grew solemn again
he heard all about the milkman and my time in galloway and my deciphering scudders notes at the inn
youve got them here he asked sharply and drew a long breath when i whipped the little book from my pocket
i said nothing of the contents
then i described my meeting with sir harry and the speeches at the hall
at that he laughed uproariously
harry talked dashed nonsense did he
i quite believe it
hes as good a chap as ever breathed but his idiot of an uncle has stuffed his head with maggots
go on mr hannay  my day as roadman excited him a bit
he made me describe the two fellows in the car very closely and seemed to be raking back in his memory
he grew merry again when he heard of the fate of that ass jopley
but the old man in the moorland house solemnized him
again i had to describe every detail of his appearance
bland and baldheaded and hooded his eyes like a bird
he sounds a sinister wildfowl
and you dynamited his hermitage after he had saved you from the police
spirited piece of work that presently i reached the end of my wanderings
he got up slowly and looked down at me from the hearthrug
you may dismiss the police from your mind he said
youre in no danger from the law of this land  great scot i cried
have they got the murderer  no
but for the last fortnight they have dropped you from the list of possibles  why i asked in amazement
principally because i received a letter from scudder
i knew something of the man and he did several jobs for me
he was half crank half genius but he was wholly honest
the trouble about him was his partiality for playing a lone hand
that made him pretty well useless in any secret servicea pity for he had uncommon gifts
i think he was the bravest man in the world for he was always shivering with fright and yet nothing would choke him off
i had a letter from him on the 31st of may  but he had been dead a week by then  the letter was written and posted on the 23rd
he evidently did not anticipate an immediate decease
his communications usually took a week to reach me for they were sent under cover to spain and then to newcastle
he had a mania you know for concealing his tracks  what did he say i stammered
nothing
merely that he was in danger but had found shelter with a good friend and that i would hear from him before the 15th of june
he gave me no address but said he was living near portland place
i think his object was to clear you if anything happened
when i got it i went to scotland yard went over the details of the inquest and concluded that you were the friend
we made inquiries about you mr hannay and found you were respectable
i thought i knew the motives for your disappearancenot only the police the other one tooand when i got harrys scrawl i guessed at the rest
i have been expecting you any time this past week  you can imagine what a load this took off my mind
i felt a free man once more for i was now up against my countrys enemies only and not my countrys law
now let us have the little notebook said sir walter
it took us a good hour to work through it
i explained the cypher and he was jolly quick at picking it up
he emended my reading of it on several points but i had been fairly correct on the whole
his face was very grave before he had finished and he sat silent for a while
i dont know what to make of it he said at last
he is right about one thingwhat is going to happen the day after tomorrow
how the devil can it have got known
that is ugly enough in itself
but all this about war and the black stoneit reads like some wild melodrama
if only i had more confidence in scudders judgement
the trouble about him was that he was too romantic
he had the artistic temperament and wanted a story to be better than god meant it to be
he had a lot of odd biases too
jews for example made him see red
jews and the high finance
the black stone he repeated
der schwarze stein
its like a penny novelette
and all this stuff about karolides
that is the weak part of the tale for i happen to know that the virtuous karolides is likely to outlast us both
there is no state in europe that wants him gone
besides he has just been playing up to berlin and vienna and giving my chief some uneasy moments
no
scudder has gone off the track there
frankly hannay i dont believe that part of his story
theres some nasty business afoot and he found out too much and lost his life over it
but i am ready to take my oath that it is ordinary spy work
a certain great european power makes a hobby of her spy system and her methods are not too particular
since she pays by piecework her blackguards are not likely to stick at a murder or two
they want our naval dispositions for their collection at the marineamt but they will be pigeonholednothing more  just then the butler entered the room
theres a trunkcall from london sir walter
its mr eath and he wants to speak to you personally  my host went off to the telephone
he returned in five minutes with a whitish face
i apologize to the shade of scudder he said
karolides was shot dead this evening at a few minutes after seven     chapter viii
the coming of the black stone   i came down to breakfast next morning after eight hours of blessed dreamless sleep to find sir walter decoding a telegram in the midst of muffins and marmalade
his fresh rosiness of yesterday seemed a thought tarnished
i had a busy hour on the telephone after you went to bed he said
i got my chief to speak to the first lord and the secretary for war and they are bringing royer over a day sooner
this wire clinches it
he will be in london at five
odd that the code word for a souschef détat majorgeneral should be porker  he directed me to the hot dishes and went on
not that i think it will do much good
if your friends were clever enough to find out the first arrangement they are clever enough to discover the change
i would give my head to know where the leak is
we believed there were only five men in england who knew about royers visit and you may be certain there were fewer in france for they manage these things better there  while i ate he continued to talk making me to my surprise a present of his full confidence
can the dispositions not be changed i asked
they could he said
but we want to avoid that if possible
they are the result of immense thought and no alteration would be as good
besides on one or two points change is simply impossible
still something could be done i suppose if it were absolutely necessary
but you see the difficulty hannay
our enemies are not going to be such fools as to pick royers pocket or any childish game like that
they know that would mean a row and put us on our guard
their aim is to get the details without any one of us knowing so that royer will go back to paris in the belief that the whole business is still deadly secret
if they cant do that they fail for once we suspect they know that the whole thing must be altered  then we must stick by the frenchmans side till he is home again i said
if they thought they could get the information in paris they would try there
it means that they have some deep scheme on foot in london which they reckon is going to win out  royer dines with my chief and then comes to my house where four people will see himwhittaker from the admiralty myself sir arthur drew and general winstanley
the first lord is ill and has gone to sheringham
at my house he will get a certain document from whittaker and after that he will be motored to portsmouth where a destroyer will take him to havre
his journey is too important for the ordinary boattrain
he will never be left unattended for a moment till he is safe on french soil
the same with whittaker till he meets royer
that is the best we can do and its hard to see how there can be any miscarriage
but i dont mind admitting that im horribly nervous
this murder of karolides will play the deuce in the chancelleries of europe  after breakfast he asked me if i could drive a car
well youll be my chauffeur today and wear hudsons rig
youre about his size
you have a hand in this business and we are taking no risks
there are desperate men against us who will not respect the country retreat of an overworked official  when i first came to london i had bought a car and amused myself with running about the south of england so i knew something of the geography
i took sir walter to town by the bath road and made good going
it was a soft breathless june morning with a promise of sultriness later but it was delicious enough swinging through the little towns with their freshly watered streets and past the summer gardens of the thames valley
i landed sir walter at his house in queen annes gate punctually by halfpast eleven
the butler was coming up by train with the luggage
the first thing he did was to take me round to scotland yard
there we saw a prim gentleman with a cleanshaven lawyers face
ive brought you the portland place murderer was sir walters introduction
the reply was a wry smile
it would have been a welcome present bullivant
this i presume is mr richard hannay who for some days greatly interested my department  mr hannay will interest it again
he has much to tell you but not today
for certain grave reasons his tale must wait for four hours
then i can promise you you will be entertained and possibly edified
i want you to assure mr hannay that he will suffer no further inconvenience  this assurance was promptly given
you can take up your life where you left off i was told
your flat which probably you no longer wish to occupy is waiting for you and your man is still there
as you were never publicly accused we considered that there was no need of a public exculpation
but on that of course you must please yourself  we may want your assistance later on macgillivray sir walter said as we left
then he turned me loose
come and see me tomorrow hannay
i neednt tell you to keep deadly quiet
if i were you i would go to bed for you must have considerable arrears of sleep to overtake
you had better lie low for if one of your black stone friends saw you there might be trouble  i felt curiously at a loose end
at first it was very pleasant to be a free man able to go where i wanted without fearing anything
i had only been a month under the ban of the law and it was quite enough for me
i went to the savoy and ordered very carefully a very good luncheon and then smoked the best cigar the house could provide
but i was still feeling nervous
when i saw anybody look at me in the lounge i grew shy and wondered if they were thinking about the murder
after that i took a taxi and drove miles away up into north london
i walked back through fields and lines of villas and terraces and then slums and mean streets and it took me pretty nearly two hours
all the while my restlessness was growing worse
i felt that great things tremendous things were happening or about to happen and i who was the cogwheel of the whole business was out of it
royer would be landing at dover sir walter would be making plans with the few people in england who were in the secret and somewhere in the darkness the black stone would be working
i felt the sense of danger and impending calamity and i had the curious feeling too that i alone could avert it alone could grapple with it
but i was out of the game now
how could it be otherwise
it was not likely that cabinet ministers and admiralty lords and generals would admit me to their councils
i actually began to wish that i could run up against one of my three enemies
that would lead to developments
i felt that i wanted enormously to have a vulgar scrap with those gentry where i could hit out and flatten something
i was rapidly getting into a very bad temper
i didnt feel like going back to my flat
that had to be faced some time but as i still had sufficient money i thought i would put it off till next morning and go to a hotel for the night
my irritation lasted through dinner which i had at a restaurant in jermyn street
i was no longer hungry and let several courses pass untasted
i drank the best part of a bottle of burgundy but it did nothing to cheer me
an abominable restlessness had taken possession of me
here was i a very ordinary fellow with no particular brains and yet i was convinced that somehow i was needed to help this business throughthat without me it would all go to blazes
i told myself it was sheer silly conceit that four or five of the cleverest people living with all the might of the british empire at their back had the job in hand
yet i couldnt be convinced
it seemed as if a voice kept speaking in my ear telling me to be up and doing or i would never sleep again
the upshot was that about halfpast nine i made up my mind to go to queen annes gate
very likely i would not be admitted but it would ease my conscience to try
i walked down jermyn street and at the corner of duke street passed a group of young men
they were in evening dress had been dining somewhere and were going on to a musichall
one of them was mr marmaduke jopley
he saw me and stopped short
by god the murderer he cried
here you fellows hold him
thats hannay the man who did the portland place murder he gripped me by the arm and the others crowded round
i wasnt looking for any trouble but my illtemper made me play the fool
a policeman came up and i should have told him the truth and if he didnt believe it demanded to be taken to scotland yard or for that matter to the nearest police station
but a delay at that moment seemed to me unendurable and the sight of marmies imbecile face was more than i could bear
i let out with my left and had the satisfaction of seeing him measure his length in the gutter
then began an unholy row
they were all on me at once and the policeman took me in the rear
i got in one or two good blows for i think with fair play i could have licked the lot of them but the policeman pinned me behind and one of them got his fingers on my throat
through a black cloud of rage i heard the officer of the law asking what was the matter and marmie between his broken teeth declaring that i was hannay the murderer
oh damn it all i cried make the fellow shut up
i advise you to leave me alone constable
scotland yard knows all about me and youll get a proper wigging if you interfere with me  youve got to come along of me young man said the policeman
i saw you strike that gentleman crool ard
you began it too for he wasnt doing nothing
i seen you
best go quietly or ill have to fix you up  exasperation and an overwhelming sense that at no cost must i delay gave me the strength of a bull elephant
i fairly wrenched the constable off his feet floored the man who was gripping my collar and set off at my best pace down duke street
i heard a whistle being blown and the rush of men behind me
i have a very fair turn of speed and that night i had wings
in a jiffy i was in pall mall and had turned down towards st jamess park
i dodged the policeman at the palace gates dived through a press of carriages at the entrance to the mall and was making for the bridge before my pursuers had crossed the roadway
in the open ways of the park i put on a spurt
happily there were few people about and no one tried to stop me
i was staking all on getting to queen annes gate
when i entered that quiet thoroughfare it seemed deserted
sir walters house was in the narrow part and outside it three or four motorcars were drawn up
i slackened speed some yards off and walked briskly up to the door
if the butler refused me admission or if he even delayed to open the door i was done
he didnt delay
i had scarcely rung before the door opened
i must see sir walter i panted
my business is desperately important  that butler was a great man
without moving a muscle he held the door open and then shut it behind me
sir walter is engaged sir and i have orders to admit no one
perhaps you will wait  the house was of the oldfashioned kind with a wide hall and rooms on both sides of it
at the far end was an alcove with a telephone and a couple of chairs and there the butler offered me a seat
see here i whispered
theres trouble about and im in it
but sir walter knows and im working for him
if anyone comes and asks if i am here tell him a lie  he nodded and presently there was a noise of voices in the street and a furious ringing at the bell
i never admired a man more than that butler
he opened the door and with a face like a graven image waited to be questioned
then he gave them it
he told them whose house it was and what his orders were and simply froze them off the doorstep
i could see it all from my alcove and it was better than any play
i hadnt waited long till there came another ring at the bell
the butler made no bones about admitting this new visitor
while he was taking off his coat i saw who it was
you couldnt open a newspaper or a magazine without seeing that facethe grey beard cut like a spade the firm fighting mouth the blunt square nose and the keen blue eyes
i recognized the first sea lord the man they say that made the new british navy
he passed my alcove and was ushered into a room at the back of the hall
as the door opened i could hear the sound of low voices
it shut and i was left alone again
for twenty minutes i sat there wondering what i was to do next
i was still perfectly convinced that i was wanted but when or how i had no notion
i kept looking at my watch and as the time crept on to halfpast ten i began to think that the conference must soon end
in a quarter of an hour royer should be speeding along the road to portsmouth  then i heard a bell ring and the butler appeared
the door of the back room opened and the first sea lord came out
he walked past me and in passing he glanced in my direction and for a second we looked each other in the face
only for a second but it was enough to make my heart jump
i had never seen the great man before and he had never seen me
but in that fraction of time something sprang into his eyes and that something was recognition
you cant mistake it
it is a flicker a spark of light a minute shade of difference which means one thing and one thing only
it came involuntarily for in a moment it died and he passed on
in a maze of wild fancies i heard the street door close behind him
i picked up the telephone book and looked up the number of his house
we were connected at once and i heard a servants voice
is his lordship at home i asked
his lordship returned half an hour ago said the voice and has gone to bed
he is not very well tonight
will you leave a message sir  i rang off and almost tumbled into a chair
my part in this business was not yet ended
it had been a close shave but i had been in time
not a moment could be lost so i marched boldly to the door of that back room and entered without knocking
five surprised faces looked up from a round table
there was sir walter and drew the war minister whom i knew from his photographs
there was a slim elderly man who was probably whittaker the admiralty official and there was general winstanley conspicuous from the long scar on his forehead
lastly there was a short stout man with an irongrey moustache and bushy eyebrows who had been arrested in the middle of a sentence
sir walters face showed surprise and annoyance
this is mr hannay of whom i have spoken to you he said apologetically to the company
im afraid hannay this visit is illtimed  i was getting back my coolness
that remains to be seen sir i said but i think it may be in the nick of time
for gods sake gentlemen tell me who went out a minute ago  lord alloa sir walter said reddening with anger
it was not i cried it was his living image but it was not lord alloa
it was someone who recognized me someone i have seen in the last month
he had scarcely left the doorstep when i rang up lord alloas house and was told he had come in half an hour before and had gone to bed  whowho someone stammered
the black stone i cried and i sat down in the chair so recently vacated and looked round at five badly scared gentlemen
chapter ix
the thirtynine steps   nonsense said the official from the admiralty
sir walter got up and left the room while we looked blankly at the table
he came back in ten minutes with a long face
i have spoken to alloa he said
had him out of bedvery grumpy
he went straight home after mulrosss dinner  but its madness broke in general winstanley
do you mean to tell me that that man came here and sat beside me for the best part of half an hour and that i didnt detect the imposture
alloa must be out of his mind  dont you see the cleverness of it i said
you were too interested in other things to have any eyes
you took lord alloa for granted
if it had been anybody else you might have looked more closely but it was natural for him to be here and that put you all to sleep  then the frenchman spoke very slowly and in good english
the young man is right
his psychology is good
our enemies have not been foolish  he bent his wise brows on the assembly
i will tell you a tale he said
it happened many years ago in senegal
i was quartered in a remote station and to pass the time used to go fishing for big barbel in the river
a little arab mare used to carry my luncheon basketone of the salted dun breed you got at timbuctoo in the old days
well one morning i had good sport and the mare was unaccountably restless
i could hear her whinnying and squealing and stamping her feet and i kept soothing her with my voice while my mind was intent on fish
i could see her all the time as i thought out of a corner of my eye tethered to a tree twenty yards away
after a couple of hours i began to think of food
i collected my fish in a tarpaulin bag and moved down the stream towards the mare trolling my line
when i got up to her i flung the tarpaulin on her back  he paused and looked round
it was the smell that gave me warning
i turned my head and found myself looking at a lion three feet off an old maneater that was the terror of the village what was left of the mare a mass of blood and bones and hide was behind him  what happened i asked
i was enough of a hunter to know a true yarn when i heard it
i stuffed my fishingrod into his jaws and i had a pistol
also my servants came presently with rifles
but he left his mark on me he held up a hand which lacked three fingers
consider he said
the mare had been dead more than an hour and the brute had been patiently watching me ever since
i never saw the kill for i was accustomed to the mares fretting and i never marked her absence for my consciousness of her was only of something tawny and the lion filled that part
if i could blunder thus gentlemen in a land where mens senses are keen why should we busy preoccupied urban folk not err also  sir walter nodded
no one was ready to gainsay him
but i dont see went on winstanley
their object was to get these dispositions without our knowing it
now it only required one of us to mention to alloa our meeting tonight for the whole fraud to be exposed  sir walter laughed dryly
the selection of alloa shows their acumen
which of us was likely to speak to him about tonight
or was he likely to open the subject  i remembered the first sea lords reputation for taciturnity and shortness of temper
the one thing that puzzles me said the general is what good his visit here would do that spy fellow
he could not carry away several pages of figures and strange names in his head  that is not difficult the frenchman replied
a good spy is trained to have a photographic memory
like your own macaulay
you noticed he said nothing but went through these papers again and again
i think we may assume that he has every detail stamped on his mind
when i was younger i could do the same trick  well i suppose there is nothing for it but to change the plans said sir walter ruefully
whittaker was looking very glum
did you tell lord alloa what has happened he asked
no
well i cant speak with absolute assurance but im nearly certain we cant make any serious change unless we alter the geography of england  another thing must be said it was royer who spoke
i talked freely when that man was here
i told something of the military plans of my government
i was permitted to say so much
but that information would be worth many millions to our enemies
no my friends i see no other way
the man who came here and his confederates must be taken and taken at once  good god i cried and we have not a rag of a clue  besides said whittaker there is the post
by this time the news will be on its way  no said the frenchman
you do not understand the habits of the spy
he receives personally his reward and he delivers personally his intelligence
we in france know something of the breed
there is still a chance mes amis
these men must cross the sea and there are ships to be searched and ports to be watched
believe me the need is desperate for both france and britain  royers grave good sense seemed to pull us together
he was the man of action among fumblers
but i saw no hope in any face and i felt none
where among the fifty millions of these islands and within a dozen hours were we to lay hands on the three cleverest rogues in europe
then suddenly i had an inspiration
where is scudders book i cried to sir walter
quick man i remember something in it  he unlocked the door of a bureau and gave it to me
i found the place
thirtynine steps i read and again thirtynine stepsi counted themhigh tide 1017 pm  the admiralty man was looking at me as if he thought i had gone mad
dont you see its a clue i shouted
scudder knew where these fellows lairedhe knew where they were going to leave the country though he kept the name to himself
tomorrow was the day and it was some place where high tide was at 1017  they may have gone tonight someone said
not they
they have their own snug secret way and they wont be hurried
i know germans and they are mad about working to a plan
where the devil can i get a book of tide tables  whittaker brightened up
its a chance he said
lets go over to the admiralty  we got into two of the waiting motorcarsall but sir walter who went off to scotland yardto mobilize macgillivray so he said
we marched through empty corridors and big bare chambers where the charwomen were busy till we reached a little room lined with books and maps
a resident clerk was unearthed who presently fetched from the library the admiralty tide tables
i sat at the desk and the others stood round for somehow or other i had got charge of this expedition
it was no good
there were hundreds of entries and so far as i could see 1017 might cover fifty places
we had to find some way of narrowing the possibilities
i took my head in my hands and thought
there must be some way of reading this riddle
what did scudder mean by steps
i thought of dock steps but if he had meant that i didnt think he would have mentioned the number
it must be some place where there were several staircases and one marked out from the others by having thirtynine steps
then i had a sudden thought and hunted up all the steamer sailings
there was no boat which left for the continent at 1017 pm  why was high tide so important
if it was a harbour it must be some little place where the tide mattered or else it was a heavydraught boat
but there was no regular steamer sailing at that hour and somehow i didnt think they would travel by a big boat from a regular harbour
so it must be some little harbour where the tide was important or perhaps no harbour at all
but if it was a little port i couldnt see what the steps signified
there were no sets of staircases on any harbour that i had ever seen
it must be some place which a particular staircase identified and where the tide was full at 1017
on the whole it seemed to me that the place must be a bit of open coast
but the staircases kept puzzling me
then i went back to wider considerations
whereabouts would a man be likely to leave for germany a man in a hurry who wanted a speedy and a secret passage
not from any of the big harbours
and not from the channel or the west coast or scotland for remember he was starting from london
i measured the distance on the map and tried to put myself in the enemys shoes
i should try for ostend or antwerp or rotterdam and i should sail from somewhere on the east coast between cromer and dover
all this was very loose guessing and i dont pretend it was ingenious or scientific
i wasnt any kind of sherlock holmes
but i have always fancied i had a kind of instinct about questions like this
i dont know if i can explain myself but i used to use my brains as far as they went and after they came to a blank wall i guessed and i usually found my guesses pretty right
so i set out all my conclusions on a bit of admiralty paper
they ran like this  fairly certain
1 place where there are several sets of stairs one that matters distinguished by having thirtynine steps
2 full tide at 1017 pm leaving shore only possible at full tide
3 steps not dock steps and so place probably not harbour
4 no regular night steamer at 1017
means of transport must be tramp unlikely yacht or fishingboat
there my reasoning stopped
i made another list which i headed guessed but i was just as sure of the one as the other
guessed
1 place not harbour but open coast
2 boat smalltrawler yacht or launch
3 place somewhere on east coast between cromer and dover
it struck me as odd that i should be sitting at that desk with a cabinet minister a fieldmarshal two high government officials and a french general watching me while from the scribble of a dead man i was trying to drag a secret which meant life or death for us
sir walter had joined us and presently macgillivray arrived
he had sent out instructions to watch the ports and railway stations for the three men whom i had described to sir walter
not that he or anybody else thought that that would do much good
heres the most i can make of it i said
we have got to find a place where there are several staircases down to the beach one of which has thirtynine steps
i think its a piece of open coast with biggish cliffs somewhere between the wash and the channel
also its a place where full tide is at 1017 tomorrow night  then an idea struck me
is there no inspector of coastguards or some fellow like that who knows the east coast  whittaker said there was and that he lived in clapham
he went off in a car to fetch him and the rest of us sat about the little room and talked of anything that came into our heads
i lit a pipe and went over the whole thing again till my brain grew weary
about one in the morning the coastguard man arrived
he was a fine old fellow with the look of a naval officer and was desperately respectful to the company
i left the war minister to crossexamine him for i felt he would think it cheek in me to talk
we want you to tell us the places you know on the east coast where there are cliffs and where several sets of steps run down to the beach  he thought for a bit
what kind of steps do you mean sir
there are plenty of places with roads cut down through the cliffs and most roads have a step or two in them
or do you mean regular staircasesall steps so to speak  sir arthur looked towards me
we mean regular staircases i said
he reflected a minute or two
i dont know that i can think of any
wait a second
theres a place in norfolkbrattleshambeside a golfcourse where there are a couple of staircases to let the gentlemen get a lost ball  thats not it i said
then there are plenty of marine parades if thats what you mean
every seaside resort has them  i shook my head
its got to be more retired than that i said
well gentlemen i cant think of anywhere else
of course theres the ruff  whats that i asked
the big chalk headland in kent close to bradgate
its got a lot of villas on the top and some of the houses have staircases down to a private beach
its a very hightoned sort of place and the residents there like to keep by themselves  i tore open the tide tables and found bradgate
high tide there was at 1027 pm on the 15th of june
were on the scent at last i cried excitedly
how can i find out what is the tide at the ruff  i can tell you that sir said the coastguard man
i once was lent a house there in this very month and i used to go out at night to the deepsea fishing
the tides ten minutes before bradgate  i closed the book and looked round at the company
if one of those staircases has thirtynine steps we have solved the mystery gentlemen i said
i want the loan of your car sir walter and a map of the roads
if mr macgillivray will spare me ten minutes i think we can prepare something for tomorrow  it was ridiculous in me to take charge of the business like this but they didnt seem to mind and after all i had been in the show from the start
besides i was used to rough jobs and these eminent gentlemen were too clever not to see it
it was general royer who gave me my commission
i for one he said am content to leave the matter in mr hannays hands  by halfpast three i was tearing past the moonlit hedgerows of kent with macgillivrays best man on the seat beside me
chapter x
various parties converging on the sea   a pink and blue june morning found me at bradgate looking from the griffin hotel over a smooth sea to the lightship on the cock sands which seemed the size of a bellbuoy
a couple of miles farther south and much nearer the shore a small destroyer was anchored
scaife macgillivrays man who had been in the navy knew the boat and told me her name and her commanders so i sent off a wire to sir walter
after breakfast scaife got from a houseagent a key for the gates of the staircases on the ruff
i walked with him along the sands and sat down in a nook of the cliffs while he investigated the halfdozen of them
i didnt want to be seen but the place at this hour was quite deserted and all the time i was on that beach i saw nothing but the seagulls
it took him more than an hour to do the job and when i saw him coming towards me conning a bit of paper i can tell you my heart was in my mouth
everything depended you see on my guess proving right
he read aloud the number of steps in the different stairs
thirtyfour thirtyfive thirtynine fortytwo fortyseven and twentyone where the cliffs grew lower
i almost got up and shouted
we hurried back to the town and sent a wire to macgillivray
i wanted half a dozen men and i directed them to divide themselves among different specified hotels
then scaife set out to prospect the house at the head of the thirtynine steps
he came back with news that both puzzled and reassured me
the house was called trafalgar lodge and belonged to an old gentleman called appletona retired stockbroker the houseagent said
mr appleton was there a good deal in the summer time and was in residence nowhad been for the better part of a week
scaife could pick up very little information about him except that he was a decent old fellow who paid his bills regularly and was always good for a fiver for a local charity
then scaife seemed to have penetrated to the back door of the house pretending he was an agent for sewingmachines
only three servants were kept a cook a parlourmaid and a housemaid and they were just the sort that you would find in a respectable middleclass household
the cook was not the gossiping kind and had pretty soon shut the door in his face but scaife said he was positive she knew nothing
next door there was a new house building which would give good cover for observation and the villa on the other side was to let and its garden was rough and shrubby
i borrowed scaifes telescope and before lunch went for a walk along the ruff
i kept well behind the rows of villas and found a good observation point on the edge of the golfcourse
there i had a view of the line of turf along the cliff top with seats placed at intervals and the little square plots railed in and planted with bushes whence the staircases descended to the beach
i saw trafalgar lodge very plainly a redbrick villa with a veranda a tennis lawn behind and in front the ordinary seaside flowergarden full of marguerites and scraggy geraniums
there was a flagstaff from which an enormous union jack hung limply in the still air
presently i observed someone leave the house and saunter along the cliff
when i got my glasses on him i saw it was an old man wearing white flannel trousers a blue serge jacket and a straw hat
he carried fieldglasses and a newspaper and sat down on one of the iron seats and began to read
sometimes he would lay down the paper and turn his glasses on the sea
he looked for a long time at the destroyer
i watched him for half an hour till he got up and went back to the house for his luncheon when i returned to the hotel for mine
i wasnt feeling very confident
this decent commonplace dwelling was not what i had expected
the man might be the bald archaeologist of that horrible moorland farm or he might not
he was exactly the kind of satisfied old bird you will find in every suburb and every holiday place
if you wanted a type of the perfectly harmless person you would probably pitch on that
but after lunch as i sat in the hotel porch i perked up for i saw the thing i had hoped for and had dreaded to miss
a yacht came up from the south and dropped anchor pretty well opposite the ruff
she seemed about a hundred and fifty tons and i saw she belonged to the squadron from the white ensign
so scaife and i went down to the harbour and hired a boatman for an afternoons fishing
i spent a warm and peaceful afternoon
we caught between us about twenty pounds of cod and lythe and out in that dancing blue sea i took a cheerier view of things
above the white cliffs of the ruff i saw the green and red of the villas and especially the great flagstaff of trafalgar lodge
about four oclock when we had fished enough i made the boatman row us round the yacht which lay like a delicate white bird ready at a moment to flee
scaife said she must be a fast boat for her build and that she was pretty heavily engined
her name was the ariadne as i discovered from the cap of one of the men who was polishing brasswork
i spoke to him and got an answer in the soft dialect of essex
another hand that came along passed me the time of day in an unmistakable english tongue
our boatman had an argument with one of them about the weather and for a few minutes we lay on our oars close to the starboard bow
then the men suddenly disregarded us and bent their heads to their work as an officer came along the deck
he was a pleasant cleanlooking young fellow and he put a question to us about our fishing in very good english
but there could be no doubt about him
his closecropped head and the cut of his collar and tie never came out of england
that did something to reassure me but as we rowed back to bradgate my obstinate doubts would not be dismissed
the thing that worried me was the reflection that my enemies knew that i had got my knowledge from scudder and it was scudder who had given me the clue to this place
if they knew that scudder had this clue would they not be certain to change their plans
too much depended on their success for them to take any risks
the whole question was how much they understood about scudders knowledge
i had talked confidently last night about germans always sticking to a scheme but if they had any suspicions that i was on their track they would be fools not to cover it
i wondered if the man last night had seen that i recognized him
somehow i did not think he had and to that i had clung
but the whole business had never seemed so difficult as that afternoon when by all calculations i should have been rejoicing in assured success
in the hotel i met the commander of the destroyer to whom scaife introduced me and with whom i had a few words
then i thought i would put in an hour or two watching trafalgar lodge
i found a place farther up the hill in the garden of an empty house
from there i had a full view of the court on which two figures were having a game of tennis
one was the old man whom i had already seen the other was a younger fellow wearing some club colours in the scarf round his middle
they played with tremendous zest like two city gents who wanted hard exercise to open their pores
you couldnt conceive a more innocent spectacle
they shouted and laughed and stopped for drinks when a maid brought out two tankards on a salver
i rubbed my eyes and asked myself if i was not the most immortal fool on earth
mystery and darkness had hung about the men who hunted me over the scotch moor in aeroplane and motorcar and notably about that infernal antiquarian
it was easy enough to connect those folk with the knife that pinned scudder to the floor and with fell designs on the worlds peace
but here were two guileless citizens taking their innocuous exercise and soon about to go indoors to a humdrum dinner where they would talk of market prices and the last cricket scores and the gossip of their native surbiton
i had been making a net to catch vultures and falcons and lo and behold
two plump thrushes had blundered into it
presently a third figure arrived a young man on a bicycle with a bag of golfclubs slung on his back
he strolled round to the tennis lawn and was welcomed riotously by the players
evidently they were chaffing him and their chaff sounded horribly english
then the plump man mopping his brow with a silk handkerchief announced that he must have a tub
i heard his very wordsive got into a proper lather he said
this will bring down my weight and my handicap bob
ill take you on tomorrow and give you a stroke a hole you couldnt find anything much more english than that
they all went into the house and left me feeling a precious idiot
i had been barking up the wrong tree this time
these men might be acting but if they were where was their audience
they didnt know i was sitting thirty yards off in a rhododendron
it was simply impossible to believe that these three hearty fellows were anything but what they seemedthree ordinary gameplaying suburban englishmen wearisome if you like but sordidly innocent
and yet there were three of them and one was old and one was plump and one was lean and dark and their house chimed in with scudders notes and half a mile off was lying a steam yacht with at least one german officer
i thought of karolides lying dead and all europe trembling on the edge of earthquake and the men i had left behind me in london who were waiting anxiously for the events of the next hours
there was no doubt that hell was afoot somewhere
the black stone had won and if it survived this june night would bank its winnings
there seemed only one thing to dogo forward as if i had no doubts and if i was going to make a fool of myself to do it handsomely
never in my life have i faced a job with greater disinclination
i would rather in my then mind have walked into a den of anarchists each with his browning handy or faced a charging lion with a popgun than enter that happy home of three cheerful englishmen and tell them that their game was up
how they would laugh at me
but suddenly i remembered a thing i once heard in rhodesia from old peter pienaar
i have quoted peter already in this narrative
he was the best scout i ever knew and before he had turned respectable he had been pretty often on the windy side of the law when he had been wanted badly by the authorities
peter once discussed with me the question of disguises and he had a theory which struck me at the time
he said barring absolute certainties like fingerprints mere physical traits were very little use for identification if the fugitive really knew his business
he laughed at things like dyed hair and false beards and such childish follies
the only thing that mattered was what peter called atmosphere
if a man could get into perfectly different surroundings from those in which he had been first observed andthis is the important partreally play up to these surroundings and behave as if he had never been out of them he would puzzle the cleverest detectives on earth
and he used to tell a story of how he once borrowed a black coat and went to church and shared the same hymnbook with the man that was looking for him
if that man had seen him in decent company before he would have recognized him but he had only seen him snuffing the lights in a publichouse with a revolver
the recollection of peters talk gave me the first real comfort that i had had that day
peter had been a wise old bird and these fellows i was after were about the pick of the aviary
what if they were playing peters game
a fool tries to look different a clever man looks the same and is different
again there was that other maxim of peters which had helped me when i had been a roadman
if you are playing a part you will never keep it up unless you convince yourself that you are it that would explain the game of tennis
those chaps didnt need to act they just turned a handle and passed into another life which came as naturally to them as the first
it sounds a platitude but peter used to say that it was the big secret of all the famous criminals
it was now getting on for eight oclock and i went back and saw scaife to give him his instructions
i arranged with him how to place his men and then i went for a walk for i didnt feel up to any dinner
i went round the deserted golfcourse and then to a point on the cliffs farther north beyond the line of the villas
on the little trim newlymade roads i met people in flannels coming back from tennis and the beach and a coastguard from the wireless station and donkeys and pierrots padding homewards
out at sea in the blue dusk i saw lights appear on the ariadne and on the destroyer away to the south and beyond the cock sands the bigger lights of steamers making for the thames
the whole scene was so peaceful and ordinary that i got more dashed in spirits every second
it took all my resolution to stroll towards trafalgar lodge about halfpast nine
on the way i got a piece of solid comfort from the sight of a greyhound that was swinging along at a nursemaids heels
he reminded me of a dog i used to have in rhodesia and of the time when i took him hunting with me in the pali hills
we were after rhebok the dun kind and i recollected how we had followed one beast and both he and i had clean lost it
a greyhound works by sight and my eyes are good enough but that buck simply leaked out of the landscape
afterwards i found out how it managed it
against the grey rock of the kopjes it showed no more than a crow against a thundercloud
it didnt need to run away all it had to do was to stand still and melt into the background
suddenly as these memories chased across my brain i thought of my present case and applied the moral
the black stone didnt need to bolt
they were quietly absorbed into the landscape
i was on the right track and i jammed that down in my mind and vowed never to forget it
the last word was with peter pienaar
scaifes men would be posted now but there was no sign of a soul
the house stood as open as a marketplace for anybody to observe
a threefoot railing separated it from the cliff road the windows on the groundfloor were all open and shaded lights and the low sound of voices revealed where the occupants were finishing dinner
everything was as public and aboveboard as a charity bazaar
feeling the greatest fool on earth i opened the gate and rang the bell
a man of my sort who has travelled about the world in rough places gets on perfectly well with two classes what you may call the upper and the lower
he understands them and they understand him
i was at home with herds and tramps and roadmen and i was sufficiently at my ease with people like sir walter and the men i had met the night before
i cant explain why but it is a fact
but what fellows like me dont understand is the great comfortable satisfied middleclass world the folk that live in villas and suburbs
he doesnt know how they look at things he doesnt understand their conventions and he is as shy of them as of a black mamba
when a trim parlourmaid opened the door i could hardly find my voice
i asked for mr appleton and was ushered in
my plan had been to walk straight into the diningroom and by a sudden appearance wake in the men that start of recognition which would confirm my theory
but when i found myself in that neat hall the place mastered me
there were the golfclubs and tennisrackets the straw hats and caps the rows of gloves the sheaf of walkingsticks which you will find in ten thousand british homes
a stack of neatly folded coats and waterproofs covered the top of an old oak chest there was a grandfather clock ticking and some polished brass warmingpans on the walls and a barometer and a print of chiltern winning the st leger
the place was as orthodox as an anglican church
when the maid asked me for my name i gave it automatically and was shown into the smokingroom on the right side of the hall
that room was even worse
i hadnt time to examine it but i could see some framed group photographs above the mantelpiece and i could have sworn they were english public school or college
i had only one glance for i managed to pull myself together and go after the maid
but i was too late
she had already entered the diningroom and given my name to her master and i had missed the chance of seeing how the three took it
when i walked into the room the old man at the head of the table had risen and turned round to meet me
he was in evening dressa short coat and black tie as was the other whom i called in my own mind the plump one
the third the dark fellow wore a blue serge suit and a soft white collar and the colours of some club or school
the old mans manner was perfect
mr hannay he said hesitatingly
did you wish to see me
one moment you fellows and ill rejoin you
we had better go to the smokingroom  though i hadnt an ounce of confidence in me i forced myself to play the game
i pulled up a chair and sat down on it
i think we have met before i said and i guess you know my business  the light in the room was dim but so far as i could see their faces they played the part of mystification very well
maybe maybe said the old man
i havent a very good memory but im afraid you must tell me your errand sir for i really dont know it  well then i said and all the time i seemed to myself to be talking pure foolishnessi have come to tell you that the games up
i have a warrant for the arrest of you three gentlemen  arrest said the old man and he looked really shocked
arrest
good god what for  for the murder of franklin scudder in london on the 23rd day of last month  i never heard the name before said the old man in a dazed voice
one of the others spoke up
that was the portland place murder
i read about it
good heavens you must be mad sir
where do you come from  scotland yard i said
after that for a minute there was utter silence
the old man was staring at his plate and fumbling with a nut the very model of innocent bewilderment
then the plump one spoke up
he stammered a little like a man picking his words
dont get flustered uncle he said
it is all a ridiculous mistake but these things happen sometimes and we can easily set it right
it wont be hard to prove our innocence
i can show that i was out of the country on the 23rd of may and bob was in a nursing home
you were in london but you can explain what you were doing  right percy
of course thats easy enough
the 23rd
that was the day after agathas wedding
let me see
what was i doing
i came up in the morning from woking and lunched at the club with charlie symons
thenoh yes i dined with the fishmongers
i remember for the punch didnt agree with me and i was seedy next morning
hang it all theres the cigarbox i brought back from the dinner he pointed to an object on the table and laughed nervously
i think sir said the young man addressing me respectfully you will see you are mistaken
we want to assist the law like all englishmen and we dont want scotland yard to be making fools of themselves
thats so uncle  certainly bob the old fellow seemed to be recovering his voice
certainly well do anything in our power to assist the authorities
butbut this is a bit too much
i cant get over it  how nellie will chuckle said the plump man
she always said that you would die of boredom because nothing ever happened to you
and now youve got it thick and strong and he began to laugh very pleasantly
by jove yes
just think of it
what a story to tell at the club
really mr hannay i suppose i should be angry to show my innocence but its too funny
i almost forgive you the fright you gave me
you looked so glum i thought i might have been walking in my sleep and killing people  it couldnt be acting it was too confoundedly genuine
my heart went into my boots and my first impulse was to apologize and clear out
but i told myself i must see it through even though i was to be the laughingstock of britain
the light from the dinnertable candlesticks was not very good and to cover my confusion i got up walked to the door and switched on the electric light
the sudden glare made them blink and i stood scanning the three faces
well i made nothing of it
one was old and bald one was stout one was dark and thin
there was nothing in their appearance to prevent them being the three who had hunted me in scotland but there was nothing to identify them
i simply cant explain why i who as a roadman had looked into two pairs of eyes and as ned ainslie into another pair why i who have a good memory and reasonable powers of observation could find no satisfaction
they seemed exactly what they professed to be and i could not have sworn to one of them
there in that pleasant diningroom with etchings on the walls and a picture of an old lady in a bib above the mantelpiece i could see nothing to connect them with the moorland desperadoes
there was a silver cigarettebox beside me and i saw that it had been won by percival appleton esq of the st bedes club in a golf tournament
i had to keep a firm hold of peter pienaar to prevent myself bolting out of that house
well said the old man politely are you reassured by your scrutiny sir  i couldnt find a word
i hope youll find it consistent with your duty to drop this ridiculous business
i make no complaint but youll see how annoying it must be to respectable people  i shook my head
o lord said the young man
this is a bit too thick  do you propose to march us off to the police station asked the plump one
that might be the best way out of it but i suppose you wont be content with the local branch
i have the right to ask to see your warrant but i dont wish to cast any aspersions upon you
you are only doing your duty
but youll admit its horribly awkward
what do you propose to do  there was nothing to do except to call in my men and have them arrested or to confess my blunder and clear out
i felt mesmerized by the whole place by the air of obvious innocencenot innocence merely but frank honest bewilderment and concern in the three faces
oh peter pienaar i groaned inwardly and for a moment i was very near damning myself for a fool and asking their pardon
meantime i vote we have a game of bridge said the plump one
it will give mr hannay time to think over things and you know we have been wanting a fourth player
do you play sir  i accepted as if it had been an ordinary invitation at the club
the whole business had mesmerized me
we went into the smokingroom where a cardtable was set out and i was offered things to smoke and drink
i took my place at the table in a kind of dream
the window was open and the moon was flooding the cliffs and sea with a great tide of yellow light
there was moonshine too in my head
the three had recovered their composure and were talking easilyjust the kind of slangy talk you will hear in any golf clubhouse
i must have cut a rum figure sitting there knitting my brows with my eyes wandering
my partner was the young dark one
i play a fair hand at bridge but i must have been rank bad that night
they saw that they had got me puzzled and that put them more than ever at their ease
i kept looking at their faces but they conveyed nothing to me
it was not that they looked different they were different
i clung desperately to the words of peter pienaar
then something awoke me
the old man laid down his hand to light a cigar
he didnt pick it up at once but sat back for a moment in his chair with his fingers tapping on his knees
it was the movement i remembered when i had stood before him in the moorland farm with the pistols of his servants behind me
a little thing lasting only a second and the odds were a thousand to one that i might have had my eyes on my cards at the time and missed it
but i didnt and in a flash the air seemed to clear
some shadow lifted from my brain and i was looking at the three men with full and absolute recognition
the clock on the mantelpiece struck ten oclock
the three faces seemed to change before my eyes and reveal their secrets
the young one was the murderer
now i saw cruelty and ruthlessness where before i had only seen goodhumour
his knife i made certain had skewered scudder to the floor
his kind had put the bullet in karolides
the plump mans features seemed to dislimn and form again as i looked at them
he hadnt a face only a hundred masks that he could assume when he pleased
that chap must have been a superb actor
perhaps he had been lord alloa of the night before perhaps not it didnt matter
i wondered if he was the fellow who had first tracked scudder and left his card on him
scudder had said he lisped and i could imagine how the adoption of a lisp might add terror
but the old man was the pick of the lot
he was sheer brain icy cool calculating as ruthless as a steam hammer
now that my eyes were opened i wondered where i had seen the benevolence
his jaw was like chilled steel and his eyes had the inhuman luminosity of a birds
i went on playing and every second a greater hate welled up in my heart
it almost choked me and i couldnt answer when my partner spoke
only a little longer could i endure their company
whew
bob
look at the time said the old man
youd better think about catching your train
bobs got to go to town tonight he added turning to me
the voice rang now as false as hell
i looked at the clock and it was nearly halfpast ten
i am afraid he must put off his journey i said
oh damn said the young man
i thought you had dropped that rot
ive simply got to go
you can have my address and ill give any security you like  no i said you must stay  at that i think they must have realized that the game was desperate
their only chance had been to convince me that i was playing the fool and that had failed
but the old man spoke again
ill go bail for my nephew
that ought to content you mr hannay was it fancy or did i detect some halt in the smoothness of that voice
there must have been for as i glanced at him his eyelids fell in that hawklike hood which fear had stamped on my memory
i blew my whistle
in an instant the lights were out
a pair of strong arms gripped me round the waist covering the pockets in which a man might be expected to carry a pistol
schnell franz cried a voice das boot das boot as it spoke i saw two of my fellows emerge on the moonlit lawn
the young dark man leapt for the window was through it and over the low fence before a hand could touch him
i grappled the old chap and the room seemed to fill with figures
i saw the plump one collared but my eyes were all for the outofdoors where franz sped on over the road towards the railed entrance to the beach stairs
one man followed him but he had no chance
the gate of the stairs locked behind the fugitive and i stood staring with my hands on the old boys throat for such a time as a man might take to descend those steps to the sea
suddenly my prisoner broke from me and flung himself on the wall
there was a click as if a lever had been pulled
then came a low rumbling far far below the ground and through the window i saw a cloud of chalky dust pouring out of the shaft of the stairway
someone switched on the light
the old man was looking at me with blazing eyes
he is safe he cried
you cannot follow in time
he is gone
he has triumphed der schwarze stein ist in der siegeskrone  there was more in those eyes than any common triumph
they had been hooded like a bird of prey and now they flamed with a hawks pride
a white fanatic heat burned in them and i realized for the first time the terrible thing i had been up against
this man was more than a spy in his foul way he had been a patriot
as the handcuffs clinked on his wrists i said my last word to him
i hope franz will bear his triumph well
i ought to tell you that the ariadne for the last hour has been in our hands  seven weeks later as all the world knows we went to war
i joined the new army the first week and owing to my matabele experience got a captains commission straight off
but i had done my best service i think before i put on khaki
