oneiin the corner of a firstclass smoking carriage mr justice wargrave lately retired from the bench puffed at a cigar and ran an interested eye through the political news in the times
he laid the paper down and glanced out of the window
they were running now through somerset
he glanced at his watchanother two hours to go
he went over in his mind all that had appeared in the papers about soldier island
there had been its original purchase by an american millionaire who was crazy about yachtingand an account of the luxurious modern house he had built on this little island off the devon coast
the unfortunate fact that the new third wife of the american millionaire was a bad sailor had led to the subsequent putting up of the house and island for sale
various glowing advertisements of it had appeared in the papers
then came the first bald statement that it had been boughtby a mr owen
after that the rumours of the gossip writers had started
soldier island had really been bought by miss gabrielle turl the hollywood film star
she wanted to spend some months there free from all publicity
busy bee had hinted delicately that it was to be an abode for royalty
mr merryweather had had it whispered to him that it had been bought for a honeymoonyoung lord lhad surrendered to cupid at last
jonas knew for a fact that it had been purchased by the admiralty with a view to carrying out some very hushhush experiments
definitely soldier island was news
from his pocket mr justice wargrave drew out a letter
the handwriting was practically illegible but words here and there stood out with unexpected clarity
dearest lawrence  such years since i heard anything of you  must come to soldier island  the most enchanting place  so much to talk over  old days  communion with nature  bask in sunshine 1240 from paddington  meet you at oakbridge  and his correspondent signed herself with a flourish his ever constance culmington
mr justice wargrave cast back in his mind to remember when exactly he had last seen lady constance culmington
it must be sevenno eight years ago
she had then been going to italy to bask in the sun and be at one with nature and the contadini
later he had heard she had proceeded to syria where she proposed to bask in a yet stronger sun and live at one with nature and the bedouin
constance culmington he reflected to himself was exactly the sort of woman who would buy an island and surround herself with mystery
nodding his head in gentle approval of his logic mr justice wargrave allowed his head to nod
he slept
iivera claythorne in a thirdclass carriage with five other travellers in it leaned her head back and shut her eyes
how hot it was travelling by train today
it would be nice to get to the sea
really a great piece of luck getting this job
when you wanted a holiday post it nearly always meant looking after a swarm of childrensecretarial holiday posts were much more difficult to get
even the agency hadnt held out much hope
and then the letter had come
i have received your name from the skilled womens agency together with their recommendation
i understand they know you personally
i shall be glad to pay you the salary you ask and shall expect you to take up your duties on august 8th
the train is the 1240 from paddington and you will be met at oakbridge station
i enclose five Â£1 notes for expenses
yours trulyuna nancy owenand at the top was the stamped address soldier island sticklehaven devon
soldier island
why there had been nothing else in the papers lately
all sorts of hints and interesting rumours
though probably they were mostly untrue
but the house had certainly been built by a millionaire and was said to be absolutely the last word in luxury
vera claythorne tired by a recent strenuous term at school thought to herself being a games mistress in a thirdclass school isnt much of a catch  if only i could get a job at some decent schooland then with a cold feeling round her heart she thought but im lucky to have even this
after all people dont like a coroners inquest even if the coroner did acquit me of all blamehe had even complimented her on her presence of mind and courage she remembered
for an inquest it couldnt have gone better
and mrs hamilton had been kindness itself to heronly hugobut she wouldnt think of hugo
suddenly in spite of the heat in the carriage she shivered and wished she wasnt going to the sea
a picture rose clearly before her mind
cyrils head bobbing up and down swimming to the rock  up and downup and down  and herself swimming in easy practised strokes after himcleaving her way through the water but knowing only too surely that she wouldnt be in time
the seaits deep warm bluemornings spent lying out on the sandshugohugo who had said he loved her
she must not think of hugo
she opened her eyes and frowned across at the man opposite her
a tall man with a brown face light eyes set rather close together and an arrogant almost cruel mouth
she thought to herselfi bet hes been to some interesting parts of the world and seen some interesting things
iiiphilip lombard summing up the girl opposite in a mere flash of his quick moving eyes thought to himselfquite attractivea bit schoolmistressy perhapsa cool customer he should imagineand one who could hold her ownin love or war
hed rather like to take her on
he frowned
no cut out all that kind of stuff
this was business
hed got to keep his mind on the job
what exactly was up he wondered
that little jew had been damned mysterious
take it or leave it captain lombardhe had said thoughtfullya hundred guineas ehhe had said it in a casual way as though a hundred guineas was nothing to him
a hundred guineas when he was literally down to his last square meal
he had fancied though that the little jew had not been deceivedthat was the damnable part about jews you couldnt deceive them about moneythey knew
he said in the same casual toneand you cant give me any further informationmr isaac morris had shaken his little bald head very positively
no captain lombard the matter rests there
it is understood by my client that your reputation is that of a good man in a tight place
i am empowered to hand you one hundred guineas in return for which you will travel to sticklehaven devon
the nearest station is oakbridge you will be met there and motored to sticklehaven where a motor launch will convey you to soldier island
there you will hold yourself at the disposal of my clientlombard had said abruptlyfor how longnot longer than a week at mostfingering his small moustache captain lombard saidyou understand i cant undertake anythingillegalhe had darted a very sharp glance at the other as he had spoken
there had been a very faint smile on the thick semitic lips of mr morris as he answered gravelyif anything illegal is proposed you will of course be at perfect liberty to withdrawdamn the smooth little brute he had smiled
it was as though he knew very well that in lombards past actions legality had not always been a sine qua non
lombards own lips parted in a grin
by jove hed sailed pretty near the wind once or twice
but hed always got away with it
there wasnt much he drew the line at really
no there wasnt much hed draw the line at
he fancied that he was going to enjoy himself at soldier island
ivin a nonsmoking carriage miss emily brent sat very upright as was her custom
she was sixtyfive and she did not approve of lounging
her father a colonel of the old school had been particular about deportment
the present generation was shamelessly laxin their carriage and in every other way
enveloped in an aura of righteousness and unyielding principles miss brent sat in her crowded thirdclass carriage and triumphed over its discomfort and its heat
everyone made such a fuss over things nowadays
they wanted injections before they had teeth pulledthey took drugs if they couldnt sleepthey wanted easy chairs and cushions and the girls allowed their figures to slop about anyhow and lay about half naked on the beaches in summer
miss brents lips set closely
she would like to make an example of certain people
she remembered last years summer holiday
this year however it would be quite different
soldier island
mentally she reread the letter which she had already read so many times
dear miss brenti do hope you remember me
we were together at belhaven guest house in august some years ago and we seemed to have so much in common
i am starting a guest house of my own on an island off the coast of devon
i think there is really an opening for a place where there is good plain cooking and a nice oldfashioned type of person
none of this nudity and gramophones half the night
i shall be very glad if you could see your way to spending your summer holiday on soldier islandquite freeas my guest
would early in august suit you
perhaps the 8th
yours sincerelyunowhat was the name
the signature was rather difficult to read
emily brent thought impatiently so many people write their signatures quite illegiblyshe let her mind run back over the people at belhaven
she had been there two summers running
there had been that nice middleaged womanmissmissnow what was her nameher father had been a canon
and there had been a mrs oltonormenno surely it was oliver
yesoliver
soldier island
there had been things in the paper about soldier islandsomething about a film staror was it an american millionaire
of course often those places went very cheapislands didnt suit everybody
they thought the idea was romantic but when they came to live there they realized the disadvantages and were only too glad to sell
emily brent thought to herself i shall be getting a free holiday at any ratewith her income so much reduced and so many dividends not being paid that was indeed something to take into consideration
if only she could remember a little more about mrsor was it missoliver
vgeneral macarthur looked out of the carriage window
the train was just coming into exeter where he had to change
damnable these slow branch line trains
this place soldier island was really no distance at all as the crow flies
he hadnt got it clear who this fellow owen was
a friend of spoof leggards apparentlyand of johnnie dyers
one or two of your old cronies are comingwould like to have a talk over old timeswell hed enjoy a chat about old times
hed had a fancy lately that fellows were rather fighting shy of him
all owing to that damned rumour
by god it was pretty hardnearly thirty years ago now
armitage had talked he supposed
damned young pup
what did he know about it
oh well no good brooding about these things
one fancied things sometimesfancied a fellow was looking at you queerly
this soldier island now hed be interested to see it
a lot of gossip flying about
looked as though there might be something in the rumour that the admiralty or the war office or the air force had got hold of it
young elmer robson the american millionaire had actually built the place
spent thousands on it so it was said
every mortal luxury
exeter
and an hour to wait
and he didnt want to wait
he wanted to get on
vidr armstrong was driving his morris across salisbury plain
he was very tired  success had its penalties
there had been a time when he had sat in his consulting room in harley street correctly apparelled surrounded with the most up to date appliances and the most luxurious furnishings and waitedwaited through the empty days for his venture to succeed or fail
well it had succeeded
hed been lucky
lucky and skilful of course
he was a good man at his jobbut that wasnt enough for success
you had to have luck as well
and hed had it
an accurate diagnosis a couple of grateful women patientswomen with money and positionand word had got about
you ought to try armstrongquite a young manbut so cleverpam had been to all sorts of people for years and he put his finger on the trouble at once the ball had started rolling
and now dr armstrong had definitely arrived
his days were full
he had little leisure
and so on this august morning he was glad that he was leaving london and going to be for some days on an island off the devon coast
not that it was exactly a holiday
the letter he had received had been rather vague in its terms but there was nothing vague about the accompanying cheque
a whacking fee
these owens must be rolling in money
some little difficulty it seemed a husband who was worried about his wifes health and wanted a report on it without her being alarmed
she wouldnt hear of seeing a doctor
her nervesnerves
the doctors eyebrows went up
these women and their nerves
well it was good for business after all
half the women who consulted him had nothing the matter with them but boredom but they wouldnt thank you for telling them so
and one could usually find something
a slightly uncommon condition of the some long word nothing at all seriousbut it needs just putting right
a simple treatmentwell medicine was mostly faithhealing when it came to it
and he had a good mannerhe could inspire hope and belief
lucky that hed managed to pull himself together in time after that business tenno fifteen years ago
it had been a near thing that
hed been going to pieces
the shock had pulled him together
hed cut out drink altogether
by jove it had been a near thing though
with a devastating earsplitting blast on the horn an enormous supersports dalmain car rushed past him at eighty miles an hour
dr armstrong nearly went into the hedge
one of these young fools who tore round the country
he hated them
that had been a near shave too
damned young fool
viitony marston roaring down into mere thought to himselfthe amount of cars crawling about the roads is frightful
always something blocking your way
and they will drive in the middle of the road
pretty hopeless driving in england anyway
not like france where you really could let outshould he stop here for a drink or push on
heaps of time
only another hundred miles and a bit to go
hed have a gin and ginger beer
fizzing hot day
this island place ought to be rather good funif the weather lasted
who were these owens he wondered
rich and stinking probably
badger was rather good at nosing people like that out
of course he had to poor old chap with no money of his own
hope theyd do one well in drinks
never knew with these fellows whod made their money and werent born to it
pity that story about gabrielle turl having bought soldier island wasnt true
hed like to have been in with that film star crowd
oh well he supposed thered be a few girls there
coming out of the hotel he stretched himself yawned looked up at the blue sky and climbed into the dalmain
several young women looked at him admiringlyhis six feet of wellproportioned body his crisp hair tanned face and intensely blue eyes
he let in the clutch with a roar and leapt up the narrow street
old men and errand boys jumped for safety
the latter looked after the car admiringly
anthony marston proceeded on his triumphal progress
viiimr blore was in the slow train from plymouth
there was only one other person in his carriage an elderly seafaring gentleman with a bleary eye
at the present moment he had dropped off to sleep
mr blore was writing carefully in a little notebook
thats the lot he muttered to himself
emily brent vera claythorne dr armstrong anthony marston old justice wargrave philip lombard general macarthur cmg dso
manservant and wife mr and mrs rogershe closed the notebook and put it back in his pocket
he glanced over at the corner and the slumbering man
had one over the eight diagnosed mr blore accurately
he went over things carefully and conscientiously in his mind
job ought to be easy enough he ruminated
dont see how i can slip up on it
hope i look all righthe stood up and scrutinized himself anxiously in the glass
the face reflected there was of a slightly military cast with a moustache
there was very little expression in it
the eyes were grey and set rather close together
might be a major said mr blore
no i forgot
theres that old military gent
hed spot me at oncesouth africa said mr blore thats my line
none of these people have anything to do with south africa and ive just been reading that travel folder so i can talk about it all rightfortunately there were all sorts and types of colonials
as a man of means from south africa mr blore felt that he could enter into any society unchallenged
soldier island
he remembered soldier island as a boy  smelly sort of rock covered with gullsstood about a mile from the coast
funny idea to go and build a house on it
awful in bad weather
but millionaires were full of whims
the old man in the corner woke up and saidyou cant never tell at seanevermr blore said soothingly thats right
you cantthe old man hiccupped twice and said plaintivelytheres a squall comingmr blore saidno no mate its a lovely daythe old man said angrilytheres a squall ahead
i can smell itmaybe youre right said mr blore pacifically
the train stopped at a station and the old fellow rose unsteadily
thish where i get out he fumbled with the window
mr blore helped him
the old man stood in the doorway
he raised a solemn hand and blinked his bleary eyes
watch and pray he said
watch and pray
the day of judgment is at handhe collapsed through the doorway on to the platform
from a recumbent position he looked up at mr blore and said with immense dignityim talking to you young man
the day of judgment is very close at handsubsiding on to his seat mr blore thought to himself hes nearer the day of judgment than i am
but there as it happens he was wrong
twoioutside oakbridge station a little group of people stood in momentary uncertainty
behind them stood porters with suitcases
one of these called jimthe driver of one of the taxis stepped forward
youm for soldier island maybe he asked in a soft devon voice
four voices gave assentand then immediately afterwards gave quick surreptitious glances at each other
the driver said addressing his remarks to mr justice wargrave as the senior member of the partythere are two taxis here sir
one of them must wait till the slow train from exeter gets ina matter of five minutestheres one gentleman coming by that
perhaps one of you wouldnt mind waiting
youd be more comfortable that wayvera claythorne her own secretarial position clear in her mind spoke at once
ill wait she said if you will go on she looked at the other three her glance and voice had that slight suggestion of command in it that comes from having occupied a position of authority
she might have been directing which tennis sets the girls were to play in
miss brent said stiffly thank you bent her head and entered one of the taxis the door of which the driver was holding open
mr justice wargrave followed her
captain lombard saidill wait with missclaythorne said vera
my name is lombard philip lombardthe porters were piling luggage on the taxi
inside mr justice wargrave said with due legal cautionbeautiful weather we are havingmiss brent saidyes indeeda very distinguished old gentleman she thought to herself
quite unlike the usual type of man in seaside guest houses
evidently mrs or miss oliver had good connections
mr justice wargrave inquireddo you know this part of the world welli have been to cornwall and to torquay but this is my first visit to this part of devonthe judge saidi also am unacquainted with this part of the worldthe taxi drove off
the driver of the second taxi saidlike to sit inside while youre waitingvera said decisivelynot at allcaptain lombard smiled
he saidthat sunny wall looks more attractive
unless youd rather go inside the stationno indeed
its so delightful to get out of that stuffy trainhe answeredyes travelling by train is rather trying in this weathervera said conventionallyi do hope it laststhe weather i mean
our english summers are so treacherouswith a slight lack of originality lombard askeddo you know this part of the world wellno ive never been here before she added quickly conscientiously determined to make her position clear at once i havent even seen my employer yetyour employeryes im mrs owens secretaryoh i see just imperceptibly his manner changed
it was slightly more assuredeasier in tone
he said isnt that rather unusualvera laughed
oh no i dont think so
her own secretary was suddenly taken ill and she wired to an agency for a substitute and they sent meso that was it
and suppose you dont like the post when youve got therevera laughed again
oh its only temporarya holiday post
ive got a permanent job at a girls school
as a matter of fact im frightfully thrilled at the prospect of seeing soldier island
theres been such a lot about it in the papers
is it really very fascinatinglombard saidi dont know
i havent seen itoh really
the owens are frightfully keen on it i suppose
what are they like
do tell melombard thought awkward thisam i supposed to have met them or not
he said quicklytheres a wasp crawling up your arm
nokeep quite still he made a convincing pounce
there
its goneoh thank you
there are a lot of wasps about this summeryes i suppose its the heat
who are we waiting for do you knowi havent the least ideathe loud drawnout scream of an approaching train was heard
lombard saidthat will be the train nowit was a tall soldierly old man who appeared at the exit from the platform
his grey hair was clipped close and he had a neatly trimmed white moustache
his porter staggering slightly under the weight of the solid leather suitcase indicated vera and lombard
vera came forward in a competent manner
she saidi am mrs owens secretary
there is a car here waiting she added this is mr lombardthe faded blue eyes shrewd in spite of their age sized up lombard
for a moment a judgment showed in themhad there been any one to read it
goodlooking fellow
something just a little wrong about himthe three of them got into the waiting taxi
they drove through the sleepy streets of little oakbridge and continued about a mile on the main plymouth road
then they plunged into a maze of crosscountry lanes steep green and narrow
general macarthur saiddont know this part of devon at all
my little place is in east devonjust on the borderline of dorsetvera saidit really is lovely here
the hills and the red earth and everything so green and lusciouslookingphilip lombard said criticallyits a bit shut in  i like open country myself
where you can see whats cominggeneral macarthur said to himyouve seen a bit of the world i fancylombard shrugged his shoulders disparagingly
ive knocked about here and there sirhe thought to himself hell ask me now if i was old enough to be in the war
these old boys always dobut general macarthur did not mention the war
iithey came up over a steep hill and down a zigzag track to sticklehavena mere cluster of cottages with a fishing boat or two drawn up on the beach
illuminated by the setting sun they had their first glimpse of soldier island jutting up out of the sea to the south
vera said surprisedits a long way outshe had pictured it differently close to shore crowned with a beautiful white house
but there was no house visible only the boldly silhouetted rock with its faint resemblance to a giant head
there was something sinister about it
she shivered faintly
outside a little inn the seven stars three people were sitting
there was the hunched elderly figure of the judge the upright form of miss brent and a third mana big bluff man who came forward and introduced himself
thought we might as well wait for you he said
make one trip of it
allow me to introduce myself
names davis
natal south africas my natal spot ha hahe laughed breezily
mr justice wargrave looked at him with active malevolence
he seemed to be wishing that he could order the court to be cleared
miss emily brent was clearly not sure if she liked colonials
any one care for a little nip before we embark asked mr davis hospitably
nobody assenting to this proposition mr davis turned and held up a finger
mustnt delay then
our good host and hostess will be expecting us he said
he might have noticed that a curious constraint came over the other members of the party
it was as though the mention of their host and hostess had a curiously paralysing effect upon the guests
in response to daviss beckoning finger a man detached himself from a nearby wall against which he was leaning and came up to them
his rolling gait proclaimed him as a man of the sea
he had a weatherbeaten face and dark eyes with a slightly evasive expression
he spoke in his soft devon voice
will you be ready to be starting for the island ladies and gentlemen
the boats waiting
theres two gentlemen coming by car but mr owens orders was not to wait for them as they might arrive at any timethe party got up
their guide led them along a small stone jetty
alongside it a motorboat was lying
emily brent saidthats a very small boatthe boats owner said persuasivelyshes a fine boat that maam
you could go to plymouth in her as easy as winkingmr justice wargrave said sharplythere are a good many of usshed take double the number sirphilip lombard said in his pleasant easy voiceits quite all right
glorious weatherno swellrather doubtfully miss brent permitted herself to be helped into the boat
the others followed suit
there was as yet no fraternizing among the party
it was as though each member of it was puzzled by the other members
they were just about to cast loose when their guide paused boathook in hand
down the steep track into the village a car was coming
a car so fantastically powerful so superlatively beautiful that it had all the nature of an apparition
at the wheel sat a young man his hair blown back by the wind
in the blaze of the evening light he looked not a man but a young god a hero god out of some northern saga
he touched the horn and a great roar of sound echoed from the rocks of the bay
it was a fantastic moment
in it anthony marston seemed to be something more than mortal
afterwards more than one of those present remembered that moment
iiifred narracott sat by the engine thinking to himself that this was a queer lot
not at all his idea of what mr owens guests were likely to be
hed expected something altogether more classy
togged up women and gentlemen in yachting costume and all very rich and important looking
not at all like mr elmer robsons parties
a faint grin came to fred narracotts lips as he remembered the millionaires guests
that had been a party if you likeand the drink theyd got through
this mr owen must be a very different sort of gentleman
funny it was thought fred that hed never yet set eyes on owenor his missus either
never been down here yet he hadnt
everything ordered and paid for by that mr morris
instructions always very clear and payment prompt but it was odd all the same
the papers said there was some mystery about owen
mr narracott agreed with them
perhaps after all it was miss gabrielle turl who had bought the island
but that theory departed from him as he surveyed his passengers
not this lotnone of them looked likely to have anything to do with a film star
he summed them up dispassionately
one old maidthe sour kindhe knew them well enough
she was a tartar he could bet
old military gentlemanreal army look about him
nicelooking young ladybut the ordinary kind not glamorousno hollywood touch about her
that bluff cheery genthe wasnt a real gentleman
retired tradesman thats what he is thought fred narracott
the other gentleman the lean hungrylooking gentleman with the quick eyes he was a queer one he was
just possible he might have something to do with the pictures
no there was only one satisfactory passenger in the boat
the last gentleman the one who had arrived in the car and what a car
a car such as had never been seen in sticklehaven before
must have cost hundreds and hundreds a car like that
he was the right kind
born to money he was
if the party had been all like him  hed understand it
queer business when you came to think of itthe whole thing was queervery queer
ivthe boat churned its way round the rock
now at last the house came into view
the south side of the island was quite different
it shelved gently down to the sea
the house was there facing southlow and square and modern looking with rounded windows letting in all the light
an exciting housea house that lived up to expectation
fred narracott shut off the engine they nosed their way gently into a little natural inlet between rocks
philip lombard said sharplymust be difficult to land here in dirty weatherfred narracott said cheerfullycant land on soldier island when theres a southeasterly
sometimes tis cut off for a week or morevera claythorne thoughtthe catering must be very difficult
thats the worst of an island
all the domestic problems are so worryingthe boat grated against the rocks
fred narracott jumped out and he and lombard helped the others to alight
narracott made the boat fast to a ring in the rock
then he led the way up steps cut in the cliff
general macarthur saidha
delightful spotbut he felt uneasy
damned odd sort of place
as the party ascended the steps and came out on a terrace above their spirits revived
in the open doorway of the house a correct butler was awaiting them and something about his gravity reassured them
and then the house itself was really most attractive the view from the terrace magnificent
the butler came forward bowing slightly
he was a tall lank man greyhaired and very respectable
he saidwill you come this way pleasein the wide hall drinks stood ready
rows of bottles
anthony marstons spirits cheered up a little
hed just been thinking this was a rum kind of show
none of his lot
what could old badger have been thinking about to let him in for this
however the drinks were all right
plenty of ice too
what was it the butler chap was saying
mr owenunfortunately delayedunable to get here till tomorrow
instructionseverything they wantedif they would like to go to their rooms
 dinner would be at eight oclock
vvera had followed mrs rogers upstairs
the woman had thrown open a door at the end of a passage and vera had walked into a delightful bedroom with a big window that opened wide upon the sea and another looking east
she uttered a quick exclamation of pleasure
mrs rogers was sayingi hope youve got everything you want missvera looked round
her luggage had been brought up and had been unpacked
at one side of the room a door stood open into a pale bluetiled bathroom
she said quicklyyes everything i thinkyoull ring the bell if you want anything missmrs rogers had a flat monotonous voice
vera looked at her curiously
what a white bloodless ghost of a woman
very respectablelooking with her hair dragged back from her face and her black dress
queer light eyes that shifted the whole time from place to place
vera thoughtshe looks frightened of her own shadowyes that was itfrightened
she looked like a woman who walked in mortal fear
a little shiver passed down veras back
what on earth was the woman afraid of
she said pleasantlyim mrs owens new secretary
i expect you know thatmrs rogers saidno miss i dont know anything
just a list of the ladies and gentlemen and what rooms they were to havevera saidmrs
owen didnt mention memrs rogers eyelashes flickered
i havent seen mrs owennot yet
we only came here two days agoextraordinary people these owens thought vera
aloud she saidwhat staff is there herejust me and rogers missvera frowned
eight people in the houseten with the host and hostessand only one married couple to do for them
mrs rogers saidim a good cook and rogers is handy about the house
i didnt know of course that there was to be such a large partyvera saidbut you can manageoh yes miss i can manage
if theres to be large parties often perhaps mrs owen could get extra help invera said i expect somrs rogers turned to go
her feet moved noiselessly over the ground
she drifted from the room like a shadow
vera went over to the window and sat down on the window seat
she was faintly disturbed
everythingsomehowwas a little queer
the absence of the owens the pale ghostlike mrs rogers
and the guests
yes the guests were queer too
an oddly assorted party
vera thoughti wish id seen the owens  i wish i knew what they were likeshe got up and walked restlessly about the room
a perfect bedroom decorated throughout in the modern style
offwhite rugs on the gleaming parquet floorfaintly tinted wallsa long mirror surrounded by lights
a mantelpiece bare of ornaments save for an enormous block of white marble shaped like a bear a piece of modern sculpture in which was inset a clock
over it in a gleaming chromium frame was a big square of parchmenta poem
she stood in front of the fireplace and read it
it was the old nursery rhyme that she remembered from her childhood days
ten little soldier boys went out to dineone choked his little self and then there were nine
nine little soldier boys sat up very lateone overslept himself and then there were eight
eight little soldier boys travelling in devonone said hed stay there and then there were seven
seven little soldier boys chopping up sticksone chopped himself in halves and then there were six
six little soldier boys playing with a hivea bumble bee stung one and then there were five
five little soldier boys going in for lawone got in chancery and then there were four
four little soldier boys going out to seaa red herring swallowed one and then there were three
three little soldier boys walking in the zooa big bear hugged one and then there were two
two little soldier boys sitting in the sunone got frizzled up and then there was one
one little soldier boy left all alonehe went and hanged himself and then there were none
vera smiled
of course
this was soldier island
she went and sat again by the window looking out to sea
how big the sea was
from here there was no land to be seen anywherejust a vast expanse of blue water rippling in the evening sun
the sea  so peaceful todaysometimes so cruel  the sea that dragged you down to its depths
drowned found drowned  drowned at sea  drowneddrowneddrowned
no she wouldnt remember  she would not think of it
all that was over
vidr armstrong came to soldier island just as the sun was sinking into the sea
on the way across he had chatted to the boatmana local man
he was anxious to find out a little about these people who owned soldier island but the man narracott seemed curiously illinformed or perhaps unwilling to talk
so dr armstrong chatted instead of the weather and of fishing
he was tired after his long motor drive
his eyeballs ached
driving west you were driving against the sun
yes he was very tired
the sea and perfect peacethat was what he needed
he would like really to take a long holiday
but he couldnt afford to do that
he could afford it financially of course but he couldnt afford to drop out
you were soon forgotten nowadays
no now that he had arrived he must keep his nose to the grindstone
he thoughtall the same this evening ill imagine to myself that im not going backthat ive done with london and harley street and all the rest of itthere was something magical about an islandthe mere word suggested fantasy
you lost touch with the worldan island was a world of its own
a world perhaps from which you might never return
he thoughtim leaving my ordinary life behind meand smiling to himself he began to make plans fantastic plans for the future
he was still smiling when he walked up the rockcut steps
in a chair on the terrace an old gentleman was sitting and the sight of him was vaguely familiar to dr armstrong
where had he seen that froglike face that tortoiselike neck that hunched up attitudeyes and those pale shrewd little eyes
of courseold wargrave
hed given evidence once before him
always looked half asleep but was shrewd as could be when it came to a point of law
had great power with a juryit was said he could make their minds up for them any day of the week
hed got one or two unlikely convictions out of them
a hanging judge some people said
funny place to meet him  hereout of the world
viimr justice wargrave thought to himselfarmstrong
remember him in the witnessbox
very correct and cautious
all doctors are damned fools
harley street ones are the worst of the lot and his mind dwelt malevolently on a recent interview he had had with a suave personage in that very street
aloud he grunteddrinks are in the halldr armstrong saidi must go and pay my respects to my host and hostessmr justice wargrave closed his eyes again looking decidedly reptilian and saidyou cant do thatdr armstrong was startled
why notthe judge saidno host and hostess
very curious state of affairs
dont understand this placedr armstrong stared at him for a minute
when he thought the old gentleman had actually gone to sleep wargrave said suddenlydyou know constance culmingtonerno im afraid i dontits of no consequence said the judge
very vague womanand practically unreadable handwriting
i was just wondering if id come to the wrong housedr armstrong shook his head and went on up to the house
mr justice wargrave reflected on the subject of constance culmington
undependable like all women
his mind went on to the two women in the house the tightlipped old maid and the girl
he didnt care for the girl coldblooded young hussy
no three women if you counted the rogers woman
odd creature she looked scared to death
respectable pair and knew their job
rogers coming out on the terrace that minute the judge asked himis lady constance culmington expected do you knowrogers stared at him
no sir not to my knowledgethe judges eyebrows rose
but he only grunted
he thoughtsoldier island eh
theres a fly in the ointmentviiianthony marston was in his bath
he luxuriated in the steaming water
his limbs had felt cramped after his long drive
very few thoughts passed through his head
anthony was a creature of sensationand of action
he thought to himselfmust go through with it i suppose and thereafter dismissed everything from his mind
warm steaming watertired limbspresently a shavea cocktaildinner
and after
ixmr blore was tying his tie
he wasnt very good at this sort of thing
did he look all right
he supposed so
nobody had been exactly cordial to him  funny the way they all eyed each otheras though they knewwell it was up to him
he didnt mean to bungle his job
he glanced up at the framed nursery rhyme over the mantelpiece
neat touch having that there
he thoughtremember this island when i was a kid
never thought id be doing this sort of a job in a house here
good thing perhaps that one cant foresee the future
xgeneral macarthur was frowning to himself
damn it all the whole thing was deuced odd
not at all what hed been led to expect
for two pins hed make an excuse and get away  throw up the whole business
but the motorboat had gone back to the mainland
hed have to stay
that fellow lombard now he was a queer chap
not straight
hed swear the man wasnt straight
xias the gong sounded philip lombard came out of his room and walked to the head of the stairs
he moved like a panther smoothly and noiselessly
there was something of the panther about him altogether
a beast of preypleasant to the eye
he was smiling to himself
a weekeh
he was going to enjoy that week
xiiin her bedroom emily brent dressed in black silk ready for dinner was reading her bible
her lips moved as she followed the wordsthe heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made in the net which they hid is their own foot taken
the lord is known by the judgment which he executeth the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands
the wicked shall be turned into hellher lips tight closed
she shut the bible
rising she pinned a cairngorm brooch at her neck and went down to dinner
threeidinner was drawing to a close
the food had been good the wine perfect
rogers waited well
every one was in better spirits
they had begun to talk to each other with more freedom and intimacy
mr justice wargrave mellowed by the excellent port was being amusing in a caustic fashion dr armstrong and tony marston were listening to him
miss brent chatted to general macarthur they had discovered some mutual friends
vera claythorne was asking mr davis intelligent questions about south africa
mr davis was quite fluent on the subject
lombard listened to the conversation
once or twice he looked up quickly and his eyes narrowed
now and then his eyes played round the table studying the others
anthony marston said suddenlyquaint these things arent theyin the centre of the round table on a circular glass stand were some little china figures
soldiers said tony
soldier island
i suppose thats the ideavera leaned forward
i wonder
how many are there
tenyesten there arevera criedwhat fun
theyre the ten little soldier boys of the nursery rhyme i suppose
in my bedroom the rhyme is framed and hung up over the mantelpiecelombard saidin my room tooand mineand mineeverybody joined in the chorus
vera saidits an amusing idea isnt itmr justice wargrave gruntedremarkably childish and helped himself to port
emily brent looked at vera claythorne
vera claythorne looked at miss brent
the two women rose
in the drawing room the french windows were open on to the terrace and the sound of the sea murmuring against the rocks came up to them
emily brent said pleasant soundvera said sharply i hate itmiss brents eyes looked at her in surprise
vera flushed
she said more composedlyi dont think this place would be very agreeable in a stormemily brent agreed
ive no doubt the house is shut up in winter she said
youd never get servants to stay here for one thingvera murmuredit must be difficult to get servants anywayemily brent saidmrs
oliver has been lucky to get these two
the womans a good cookvera thoughtfunny how elderly people always get names wrongshe saidyes i think mrs owen has been very lucky indeedemily brent had brought a small piece of embroidery out of her bag
now as she was about to thread her needle she paused
she said sharplyowen
did you say owenyesemily brent said sharplyive never met anyone called owen in my lifevera stared
but surelyshe did not finish her sentence
the door opened and the men joined them
rogers followed them into the room with the coffee tray
the judge came and sat down by emily brent
armstrong came up to vera
tony marston strolled to the open window
blore studied with naÃ¯ve surprise a statuette in brasswondering perhaps if its bizarre angularities were really supposed to be the female figure
general macarthur stood with his back to the mantelpiece
he pulled at his little white moustache
that had been a damned good dinner
his spirits were rising
lombard turned over the pages of punch that lay with other papers on a table by the wall
rogers went round with the coffee tray
the coffee was goodreally black and very hot
the whole party had dined well
they were satisfied with themselves and with life
the hands of the clock pointed to twenty minutes past nine
there was a silencea comfortable replete silence
into that silence came the voice
without warning inhuman penetrating
ladies and gentlemen
silence pleaseeveryone was startled
they looked roundat each other at the walls
who was speaking
the voice went ona high clear voiceyou are charged with the following indictmentsedward george armstrong that you did upon the 14th day of march 1925 cause the death of louisa mary clees
emily caroline brent that upon the 5th of november 1931 you were responsible for the death of beatrice taylor
william henry blore that you brought about the death of james stephen landor on october 10th 1928
vera elizabeth claythorne that on the 11th day of august 1935 you killed cyril ogilvie hamilton
philip lombard that upon a date in february 1932 you were guilty of the death of twentyone men members of an east african tribe

thomas rogers and ethel rogers that on the 6th of may 1929 you brought about the death of jennifer brady
lawrence john wargrave that upon the 10th day of june 1930 you were guilty of the murder of edward seton
prisoners at the bar have you anything to say in your defenceiithe voice had stopped
there was a moments petrified silence and then a resounding crash
rogers had dropped the coffee tray
at the same moment from somewhere outside the room there came a scream and the sound of a thud
lombard was the first to move
he leapt to the door and flung it open
outside lying in a huddled mass was mrs rogers
lombard calledmarstonanthony sprang to help him
between them they lifted up the woman and carried her into the drawing room
dr armstrong came across quickly
he helped them to lift her on to the sofa and bent over her
he said quicklyits nothing
shes fainted thats all
shell be round in a minutelombard said to rogersget some brandyrogers his face white his hands shaking murmuredyes sir and slipped quickly out of the room
vera cried outwho was that speaking
where was he
it soundedit soundedgeneral macarthur spluttered outwhats going on here
what kind of a practical joke was thathis hand was shaking
his shoulders sagged
he looked suddenly ten years older
blore was mopping his face with a handkerchief
only mr justice wargrave and miss brent seemed comparatively unmoved
emily brent sat upright her head held high
in both cheeks was a spot of hard colour
the judge sat in his habitual pose his head sunk down into his neck
with one hand he gently scratched his ear
only his eyes were active darting round and round the room puzzled alert with intelligence
again it was lombard who acted
armstrong being busy with the collapsed woman lombard was free once more to take the initiative
he saidthat voice
it sounded as though it were in the roomvera criedwho was it
who was it
it wasnt one of uslike the judge lombards eyes wandered slowly round the room
they rested a minute on the open window then he shook his head decisively
suddenly his eyes lighted up
he moved forward swiftly to where a door near the fireplace led into an adjoining room
with a swift gesture he caught the handle and flung the door open
he passed through and immediately uttered an exclamation of satisfaction
he saidah here we arethe others crowded after him
only miss brent remained alone sitting erect in her chair
inside the second room a table had been brought up close to the wall which adjoined the drawing room
on the table was a gramophonean oldfashioned type with a large trumpet attached
the mouth of the trumpet was against the wall and lombard pushing it aside indicated where two or three small holes had been unobtrusively bored through the wall
adjusting the gramophone he replaced the needle on the record and immediately they heard again you are charged with the following indictmentsvera criedturn it off
turn it off
its horriblelombard obeyed
dr armstrong said with a sigh of reliefa disgraceful and heartless practical joke i supposethe small clear voice of mr justice wargrave murmuredso you think its a joke do youthe doctor stared at him
what else could it bethe hand of the judge gently stroked his upper lip
he saidat the moment im not prepared to give an opinionanthony marston broke in
he saidlook here theres one thing youve forgotten
who the devil turned the thing on and set it goingwargrave murmuredyes i think we must inquire into thathe led the way back into the drawing room
the others followed
rogers had just come in with a glass of brandy
miss brent was bending over the moaning form of mrs rogers
adroitly rogers slipped between the two women
allow me madam ill speak to her
ethelethelits all right
all right do you hear
pull yourself togethermrs rogers breath came in quick gasps
her eyes staring frightened eyes went round and round the ring of faces
there was urgency in rogers tone
pull yourself together etheldr armstrong spoke to her soothinglyyoull be all right now mrs rogers
just a nasty turn she saiddid i faint siryesit was the voicethat awful voicelike a judgmenther face turned green again her eyelids fluttered
dr armstrong said sharplywheres that brandyrogers had put it down on a little table
someone handed it to the doctor and he bent over the gasping woman with it
drink this mrs rogersshe drank choking a little and gasping
the spirit did her good
the colour returned to her face
she saidim all right now
it justgave me a turnrogers said quicklyof course it did
it gave me a turn too
fair made me drop that tray
wicked lies it was
id like to knowhe was interrupted
it was only a cougha dry little cough but it had the effect of stopping him in full cry
he stared at mr justice wargrave and the latter coughed again
then he saidwho put on that record on the gramophone
was it you rogersrogers criedi didnt know what it was
before god i didnt know what it was sir
if i had id never have done itthe judge said drylythat is probably true
but i think youd better explain rogersthe butler wiped his face with a handkerchief
he said earnestlyi was just obeying orders sir thats allwhose ordersmr
owensmr justice wargrave saidlet me get this quite clear
mr owens orders werewhat exactlyrogers saidi was to put a record on the gramophone
id find the record in the drawer and my wife was to start the gramophone when id gone into the drawing room with the coffee traythe judge murmureda very remarkable storyrogers criedits the truth sir
i swear to god its the truth
i didnt know what it wasnot for a moment
it had a name on iti thought it was just a piece of musicwargrave looked at lombard
was there a title on itlombard nodded
he grinned suddenly showed his white pointed teeth
he saidquite right sir
it was entitled swan songiiigeneral macarthur broke out suddenly
he exclaimedthe whole thing is preposterouspreposterous
slinging accusations about like this
something must be done about it
this fellow owen whoever he isemily brent interrupted
she said sharplythats just it who is hethe judge interposed
he spoke with the authority that a lifetime in the courts had given him
he saidthat is exactly what we must go into very carefully
i should suggest that you get your wife to bed first of all rogers
then come back hereyes sirdr armstrong saidill give you a hand rogersleaning on the two men mrs rogers tottered out of the room
when they had gone tony marston saiddont know about you sir but i could do with a drinklombard saidi agreetony saidill go and foragehe went out of the room
he returned a second or two later
found them all waiting on a tray outside ready to be brought inhe set down his burden carefully
the next minute or two was spent in dispensing drinks
general macarthur had a stiff whisky and so did the judge
every one felt the need of a stimulant
only emily brent demanded and obtained a glass of water
dr armstrong reentered the room
shes all right he said
ive given her a sedative to take
whats that a drink
i could do with oneseveral of the men refilled their glasses
a moment or two later rogers reentered the room
mr justice wargrave took charge of the proceedings
the room became an impromptu court of law
the judge saidnow then rogers we must get to the bottom of this
who is this mr owenrogers stared
he owns this place siri am aware of that fact
what i want you to tell me is what you yourself know about the manrogers shook his head
i cant say sir
you see ive never seen himthere was a faint stir in the room
general macarthur saidyouve never seen him
what dyer meanweve only been here just under a week sir my wife and i
we were engaged by letter through an agency
the regina agency in plymouthblore nodded
old established firm he volunteered
wargrave saidhave you got that letterthe letter engaging us
no sir
i didnt keep itgo on with your story
you were engaged as you say by letteryes sir
we were to arrive on a certain day
we did
everything was in order here
plenty of food in stock and everything very nice
just needed dusting and thatwhat nextnothing sir
we got ordersby letter againto prepare the rooms for a house party and then yesterday by the afternoon post i got another letter from mr owen
it said he and mrs owen were detained and to do the best we could and it gave the instructions about dinner and coffee and putting on the gramophone recordthe judge said sharplysurely youve got that letteryes sir ive got it herehe produced it from a pocket
the judge took it
hm he said
headed ritz hotel and typewrittenwith a quick movement blore was beside him
he saidif youll just let me have a lookhe twitched it out of the others hand and ran his eye over it
he murmuredcoronation machine
quite newno defects
ensign paperthe most widely used make
you wont get anything out of that
might be fingerprints but i doubt itwargrave stared at him with sudden attention
anthony marston was standing beside blore looking over his shoulder
he saidgot some fancy christian names hasnt he
ulick norman owen
quite a mouthfulthe old judge said with a slight starti am obliged to you mr marston
you have drawn my attention to a curious and suggestive pointhe looked round at the others and thrusting his neck forward like an angry tortoise he saidi think the time has come for us all to pool our information
it would be well i think for everybody to come forward with all the information they have regarding the owner of this house he paused and then went on we are all his guests
i think it would be profitable if each one of us were to explain exactly how that came aboutthere was a moments pause and then emily brent spoke with decision
theres something very peculiar about all this she said
i received a letter with a signature that was not very easy to read
it purported to be from a woman i had met at a certain summer resort two or three years ago
i took the name to be either ogden or oliver
i am acquainted with a mrs oliver and also with a miss ogden
i am quite certain that i have never met or become friendly with any one of the name of owenmr justice wargrave saidyou have that letter miss brentyes i will fetch it for youshe went away and returned a minute later with the letter
the judge read it
he saidi begin to understand  miss claythornevera explained the circumstances of her secretarial engagement
the judge saidmarstonanthony saidgot a wire
from a pal of mine
badger berkeley
surprised me at the time because i had an idea the old horse had gone to norway
told me to roll up hereagain wargrave nodded
he saiddr
armstrongi was called in professionallyi see
you had no previous acquaintanceship with the familyno
a colleague of mine was mentioned in the letterthe judge saidto give verisimilitude  yes and that colleague i presume was momentarily out of touch with youwelleryeslombard who had been staring at blore said suddenlylook here ive just thought of somethingthe judge lifted a hand
in a minutebut iwe will take one thing at a time mr lombard
we are at present inquiring into the causes which have resulted in our being assembled here tonight
general macarthurpulling at his moustache the general mutteredgot a letterfrom this fellow owenmentioned some old pals of mine who were to be herehoped id excuse informal invitation
havent kept the letter im afraidwargrave said mr
lombardlombards brain had been active
was he to come out in the open or not
he made up his mind
same sort of thing he said
invitation mention of mutual friendsi fell for it all right
ive torn up the lettermr justice wargrave turned his attention to mr blore
his forefinger stroked his upper lip and his voice was dangerously polite
he saidjust now we had a somewhat disturbing experience
an apparently disembodied voice spoke to us all by name uttering certain precise accusations against us
we will deal with those accusations presently
at the moment i am interested in a minor point
amongst the names recited was that of william henry blore
but as far as we know there is no one named blore amongst us
the name of davis was not mentioned
what have you to say about that mr davisblore said sulkilycats out of the bag it seems
i suppose id better admit that my name isnt davisyou are william henry blorethats righti will add something said lombard
not only are you here under a false name mr blore but in addition ive noticed this evening that youre a firstclass liar
you claim to have come from natal south africa
i know south africa and natal and im prepared to swear that youve never set foot in south africa in your lifeall eyes were turned on blore
angry suspicious eyes
anthony marston moved a step nearer to him
his fists clenched themselves
now then you swine he said
any explanationblore flung back his head and set his square jaw
you gentlemen have got me wrong he said
ive got my credentials and you can see them
im an excid man
i run a detective agency in plymouth
i was put on this jobmr justice wargrave askedby whomthis man owen
enclosed a handsome money order for expenses and instructed me as to what he wanted done
i was to join the house party posing as a guest
i was given all your names
i was to watch you allany reason givenblore said bitterlymrs
owens jewels
mrs owen my foot
i dont believe theres any such personagain the forefinger of the judge stroked his lip this time appreciatively
your conclusions are i think justified he said
ulick norman owen
in miss brents letter though the signature of the surname is a mere scrawl the christian names are reasonably clearuna nancyin either case you notice the same initials
ulick norman owenuna nancy oweneach time that is to say u n owen
or by a slight stretch of fancy unknownvera criedbut this is fantasticmadthe judge nodded gently
he saidoh yes
ive no doubt in my own mind that we have been invited here by a madmanprobably a dangerous homicidal lunaticfourithere was a moments silence
a silence of dismay and bewilderment
then the judges small clear voice took up the thread once more
we will now proceed to the next stage of our inquiry
first however i will just add my own credentials to the listhe took a letter from his pocket and tossed it on to the table
this purports to be from an old friend of mine lady constance culmington
i have not seen her for some years
she went to the east
it is exactly the kind of vague incoherent letter she would write urging me to join her here and referring to her host and hostess in the vaguest of terms
the same technique you will observe
i only mention it because it agrees with the other evidencefrom all of which emerges one interesting point
whoever it was who enticed us here that person knows or has taken the trouble to find out a good deal about us all
he whoever he may be is aware of my friendship for lady constanceand is familiar with her epistolary style
he knows something about dr armstrongs colleagues and their present whereabouts
he knows the nickname of mr marstons friend and the kind of telegrams he sends
he knows exactly where miss brent was two years ago for her holiday and the kind of people she met there
he knows all about general macarthurs old cronieshe paused
then he saidhe knows you see a good deal
and out of his knowledge concerning us he has made certain definite accusationsimmediately a babel broke out
general macarthur shouteda pack of dam lies
slandervera cried outits iniquitous her breath came fast
wickedrogers said hoarselya liea wicked lie  we never didneither of usanthony marston growleddont know what the damned fool was getting atthe upraised hand of mr justice wargrave calmed the tumult
he said picking his words with carei wish to say this
our unknown friend accuses me of the murder of one edward seton
i remember seton perfectly well
he came up before me for trial in june of the year 1930
he was charged with the murder of an elderly woman
he was very ably defended and made a good impression on the jury in the witnessbox
nevertheless on the evidence he was certainly guilty
i summed up accordingly and the jury brought in a verdict of guilty
in passing sentence of death i concurred with the verdict
an appeal was lodged on the grounds of misdirection
the appeal was rejected and the man was duly executed
i wish to say before you all that my conscience is perfectly clear on the matter
i did my duty and nothing more
i passed sentence on a rightly convicted murdererarmstrong was remembering now
the seton case
the verdict had come as a great surprise
he had met matthews kc on one of the days of the trial dining at a restaurant
matthews had been confident
not a doubt of the verdict
acquittal practically certain and then afterwards he had heard comments judge was dead against him
turned the jury right round and they brought him in guilty
quite legal though
old wargrave knows his law
it was almost as though he had a private down on the fellowall these memories rushed through the doctors mind
before he could consider the wisdom of the question he had asked impulsivelydid you know seton at all
i mean previous to the casethe hooded reptilian eyes met his
in a clear cold voice the judge saidi knew nothing of seton previous to the casearmstrong said to himselfthe fellows lyingi know hes lyingiivera claythorne spoke in a trembling voice
she saidid like to tell you
about that childcyril hamilton
i was nursery governess to him
he was forbidden to swim out far
one day when my attention was distracted he started off
i swam after him  i couldnt get there in time  it was awful  but it wasnt my fault
at the inquest the coroner exonerated me
and his mothershe was so kind
if even she didnt blame me why shouldwhy should this awful thing be said
its not fairnot fairshe broke down weeping bitterly
general macarthur patted her shoulder
he saidthere there my dear
of course its not true
fellows a madman
a madman
got a bee in his bonnet
got hold of the wrong end of the stick all roundhe stood erect squaring his shoulders
he barked outbest really to leave this sort of thing unanswered
however feel i ought to sayno truthno truth whatever in what he said abouteryoung arthur richmond
richmond was one of my officers
i sent him on a reconnaissance
he was killed
natural course of events in wartime
wish to say resent very muchslur on my wife
best woman in the world
absolutelycÃ¦sars wifegeneral macarthur sat down
his shaking hand pulled at his moustache
the effort to speak had cost him a good deal
lombard spoke
his eyes were amused
he saidabout those nativesmarston saidwhat about themphilip lombard grinned
storys quite true
i left em
matter of selfpreservation
we were lost in the bush
i and a couple of other fellows took what food there was and cleared outgeneral macarthur said sternlyyou abandoned your menleft them to starvelombard saidnot quite the act of a pukka sahib im afraid
but selfpreservations a mans first duty
and natives dont mind dying you know
they dont feel about it as europeans dovera lifted her face from her hands
she said staring at himyou left themto dielombard answeredi left them to diehis amused eyes looked into her horrified ones
anthony marston said in a slow puzzled voiceive just been thinkingjohn and lucy combes
must have been a couple of kids i ran over near cambridge
beastly bad luckmr justice wargrave said acidlyfor them or for youanthony saidwell i was thinkingfor mebut of course youre right sir it was damned bad luck on them
of course it was a pure accident
they rushed out of some cottage or other
i had my licence suspended for a year
beastly nuisancedr armstrong said warmlythis speedings all wrongall wrong
young men like you are a danger to the communityanthony shrugged his shoulders
he saidspeeds come to stay
english roads are hopeless of course
cant get up a decent pace on themhe looked round vaguely for his glass picked it up off a table and went over to the side table and helped himself to another whisky and soda
he said over his shoulderwell anyway it wasnt my fault
just an accidentiiithe manservant rogers had been moistening his lips and twisting his hands
he said now in a low deferential voiceif i might just say a word sirlombard saidgo ahead rogersrogers cleared his throat and passed his tongue once more over his dry lips
there was a mention sir of me and mrs rogers
and of miss brady
there isnt a word of truth in it sir
my wife and i were with miss brady till she died
she was always in poor health sir always from the time we came to her
there was a storm sir that nightthe night she was taken bad
the telephone was out of order
we couldnt get the doctor to her
i went for him sir on foot
but he got there too late
wed done everything possible for her sir
devoted to her we were
anyone will tell you the same
there was never a word said against us
not a wordlombard looked thoughtfully at the mans twitching face his dry lips the fright in his eyes
he remembered the crash of the falling coffee tray
he thought but did not say oh yeahblore spokespoke in his hearty bullying official manner
he saidcame into a little something at her death though
ehrogers drew himself up
he said stifflymiss brady left us a legacy in recognition of our faithful services
and why not id like to knowlombard saidwhat about yourself mr blorewhat about meyour name was included in the listblore went purple
landor you mean
that was the bank robberylondon and commercialmr justice wargrave stirred
he saidi remember
it didnt come before me but i remember the case
landor was convicted on your evidence
you were the police officer in charge of the caseblore saidi waslandor got penal servitude for life and died on dartmoor a year later
he was a delicate manblore saidhe was a crook
it was he who knocked out the night watchman
the case was quite clear against himwargrave said slowlyyou were complimented i think on your able handling of the caseblore said sulkilyi got my promotionhe added in a thick voice
i was only doing my dutylombard laugheda sudden ringing laugh
he saidwhat a dutyloving lawabiding lot we all seem to be
myself excepted
what about you doctorand your little professional mistake
illegal operation was itemily brent glanced at him in sharp distaste and drew herself away a little
dr armstrong very much master of himself shook his head goodhumouredly
im at a loss to understand the matter he said
the name meant nothing to me when it was spoken
what was itclees
close
i really cant remember having a patient of that name or being connected with a death in any way
the things a complete mystery to me
of course its a long time ago
it might possibly be one of my operation cases in hospital
they come too late so many of these people
then when the patient dies they always consider its the surgeons faulthe sighed shaking his head
he thoughtdrunkthats what it wasdrunk  and i operated
nerves all to pieceshands shaking
i killed her all right
poor devilelderly womansimple job if id been sober
lucky for me theres loyalty in our profession
the sister knew of coursebut she held her tongue
god it gave me a shock
pulled me up
but who could have known about itafter all these years
ivthere was a silence in the room
everybody was looking covertly or openly at emily brent
it was a minute or two before she became aware of the expectation
her eyebrows rose on her narrow forehead
she saidare you waiting for me to say something
i have nothing to saythe judge said nothing miss brentnothingher lips closed tightly
the judge stroked his face
he said mildlyyou reserve your defencemiss brent said coldlythere is no question of defence
i have always acted in accordance with the dictates of my conscience
i have nothing with which to reproach myselfthere was an unsatisfied feeling in the air
but emily brent was not one to be swayed by public opinion
she sat unyielding
the judge cleared his throat once or twice
then he said our inquiry rests there
now rogers who else is there on this island besides ourselves and you and your wifenobody sir
nobody at allyoure sure of thatquite sure sirwargrave saidi am not yet clear as to the purpose of our unknown host in getting us to assemble here
but in my opinion this person whoever he may be is not sane in the accepted sense of the word
he may be dangerous
in my opinion it would be well for us to leave this place as soon as possible
i suggest that we leave tonightrogers saidi beg your pardon sir but theres no boat on the islandno boat at allno sirhow do you communicate with the mainlandfred narracott he comes over every morning sir
he brings the bread and the milk and the post and takes the ordersmr justice wargrave saidthen in my opinion it would be well if we all left tomorrow morning as soon as narracotts boat arrivesthere was a chorus of agreement with only one dissentient voice
it was anthony marston who disagreed with the majority
a bit unsporting what he said
ought to ferret out the mystery before we go
whole things like a detective story
positively thrillingthe judge said acidlyat my time of life i have no desire for âthrills as you call themanthony said with a grinthe legal lifes narrowing
im all for crime
heres to ithe picked up his drink and drank it off at a gulp
too quickly perhaps
he chokedchoked badly
his face contorted turned purple
he gasped for breaththen slid down off his chair the glass falling from his hand
fiveiit was so sudden and so unexpected that it took every ones breath away
they remained stupidly staring at the crumpled figure on the ground
then dr armstrong jumped up and went over to him kneeling beside him
when he raised his head his eyes were bewildered
he said in a low awestruck whispermy god
hes deadthey didnt take it in
not at once
dead
dead
that young norse god in the prime of his health and strength
struck down all in a moment
healthy young men didnt die like that choking over a whisky and soda
no they couldnt take it in
dr armstrong was peering into the dead mans face
he sniffed at the blue twisted lips
then he picked up the glass from which anthony marston had been drinking
general macarthur saiddead
dyou mean the fellow just choked andand diedthe physician saidyou can call it choking if you like
he died of asphyxiation right enoughhe was sniffing now at the glass
he dipped a finger into the dregs and very cautiously just touched the finger with the tip of his tongue
his expression altered
general macarthur saidnever knew a man could die like thatjust of a choking fitemily brent said in a clear voicein the midst of life we are in deathdr armstrong stood up
he said brusquelyno a man doesnt die of a mere choking fit
marstons death wasnt what we call a natural deathvera said almost in a whisperwas theresomethingin the whiskyarmstrong nodded
yes
cant say exactly
everything points to one of the cyanides
no distinctive smell of prussic acid probably potassium cyanide
it acts pretty well instantaneouslythe judge said sharplyit was in his glassyesthe doctor strode to the table where the drinks were
he removed the stopper from the whisky and smelt and tasted it
then he tasted the soda water
he shook his head
theyre both all rightlombard saidyou meanhe must have put the stuff in his glass himselfarmstrong nodded with a curiously dissatisfied expression
he saidseems like itblore saidsuicide eh
thats a queer govera said slowlyyoud never think that he would kill himself
he was so alive
he wasohenjoying himself
when he came down the hill in his car this evening he lookedhe lookedoh i cant explainbut they knew what she meant
anthony marston in the height of his youth and manhood had seemed like a being who was immortal
and now crumpled and broken he lay on the floor
dr armstrong saidis there any possibility other than suicideslowly every one shook their heads
there could be no other explanation
the drinks themselves were untampered with
they had all seen anthony marston go across and help himself
it followed therefore that any cyanide in the drink must have been put there by anthony marston himself
and yetwhy should anthony marston commit suicide
blore said thoughtfullyyou know doctor it doesnt seem right to me
i shouldnt have said mr marston was a suicidal type of gentlemanarmstrong answeredi agreeiithey had left it like that
what else was there to say
together armstrong and lombard had carried the inert body of anthony marston to his bedroom and had laid him there covered over with a sheet
when they came downstairs again the others were standing in a group shivering a little though the night was not cold
emily brent saidwed better go to bed
its lateit was past twelve oclock
the suggestion was a wise oneyet every one hesitated
it was as though they clung to each others company for reassurance
the judge saidyes we must get some sleeprogers saidi havent cleared yetin the dining roomlombard said curtlydo it in the morningarmstrong said to himis your wife all rightill go and see sirhe returned a minute or two later
sleeping beautiful she isgood said the doctor
dont disturb herno sir
ill just put things straight in the dining room and make sure everythings locked up right and then ill turn inhe went across the hall into the dining room
the others went upstairs a slow unwilling procession
if this had been an old house with creaking wood and dark shadows and heavily panelled walls there might have been an eerie feeling
but this house was the essence of modernity
there were no dark cornersno possible sliding panelsit was flooded with electric lighteverything was new and bright and shining
there was nothing hidden in this house nothing concealed
it had no atmosphere about it
somehow that was the most frightening thing of all
they exchanged goodnights on the upper landing
each of them went into his or her own room and each of them automatically almost without conscious thought locked the door
iiiin his pleasant softly tinted room mr justice wargrave removed his garments and prepared himself for bed
he was thinking about edward seton
he remembered seton very well
his fair hair his blue eyes his habit of looking you straight in the face with a pleasant air of straightforwardness
that was what had made so good an impression on the jury
llewellyn for the crown had bungled it a bit
he had been overvehement had tried to prove too much
matthews on the other hand for the defence had been good
his points had told
his crossexaminations had been deadly
his handling of his client in the witnessbox had been masterly
and seton had come through the ordeal of crossexamination well
he had not got excited or overvehement
the jury had been impressed
it had seemed to matthews perhaps as though everything had been over bar the shouting
the judge wound up his watch carefully and placed it by the bed
he remembered exactly how he had felt sitting therelistening making notes appreciating everything tabulating every scrap of evidence that told against the prisoner
hed enjoyed that case
matthews final speech had been firstclass
llewellyn coming after it had failed to remove the good impression that the defending counsel had made
and then had come his own summing up
carefully mr justice wargrave removed his false teeth and dropped them into a glass of water
the shrunken lips fell in
it was a cruel mouth now cruel and predatory
hooding his eyes the judge smiled to himself
hed cooked setons goose all right
with a slightly rheumatic grunt he climbed into bed and turned out the electric light
ivdownstairs in the dining room rogers stood puzzled
he was staring at the china figures in the centre of the table
he muttered to himselfthats a rum go
i could have sworn there were ten of themvgeneral macarthur tossed from side to side
sleep would not come to him
in the darkness he kept seeing arthur richmonds face
hed liked arthurhed been damned fond of arthur
hed been pleased that leslie liked him too
leslie was so capricious
lots of good fellows that leslie would turn up her nose at and pronounce dull
dull just like that
but she hadnt found arthur richmond dull
theyd got on well together from the beginning
theyd talked of plays and music and pictures together
shed teased him made fun of him ragged him
and he macarthur had been delighted at the thought that leslie took quite a motherly interest in the boy
motherly indeed
damn fool not to remember that richmond was twentyeight to leslies twentynine
hed loved leslie
he could see her now
her heartshaped face and her dancing deep grey eyes and the brown curling mass of her hair
hed loved leslie and hed believed in her absolutely
out there in france in the middle of all the hell of it hed sat thinking of her taken her picture out of the breast pocket of his tunic
and thenhed found out
it had come about exactly in the way things happened in books
the letter in the wrong envelope
shed been writing to them both and shed put her letter to richmond in the envelope addressed to her husband
even now all these years after he could feel the shock of itthe pain
god it had hurt
and the business had been going on some time
the letter made that clear
weekends
richmonds last leave
leslieleslie and arthur
god damn the fellow
damn his smiling face his brisk yes sir liar and hypocrite
stealer of another mans wife
it had gathered slowlythat cold murderous rage
hed managed to carry on as usualto show nothing
hed tried to make his manner to richmond just the same
had he succeeded
he thought so
richmond hadnt suspected
inequalities of temper were easily accounted for out there where mens nerves were continually snapping under the strain
only young armitage had looked at him curiously once or twice
quite a young chap but hed had perceptions that boy
armitage perhaps had guessedwhen the time came
hed sent richmond deliberately to death
only a miracle could have brought him through unhurt
that miracle didnt happen
yes hed sent richmond to his death and he wasnt sorry
it had been easy enough
mistakes were being made all the time officers being sent to death needlessly
all was confusion panic
people might say afterwards old macarthur lost his nerve a bit made some colossal blunders sacrificed some of his best men they couldnt say more
but young armitage was different
hed looked at his commanding officer very oddly
hed known perhaps that richmond was being deliberately sent to death
after the war was overhad armitage talked
leslie hadnt known
leslie had wept for her lover he supposed but her weeping was over by the time hed come back to england
hed never told her that hed found her out
theyd gone on togetheronly somehow she hadnt seemed very real anymore
and then three or four years later shed got double pneumonia and died
that had been a long time ago
fifteen yearssixteen years
and hed left the army and come to live in devonbought the sort of little place hed always meant to have
nice neighbourspleasant part of the world
there was a bit of shooting and fishing
hed gone to church on sundays
but not the day that the lesson was read about david putting uriah in the forefront of the battle
somehow he couldnt face that
gave him an uncomfortable feeling
everybody had been very friendly
at first that is
later hed had an uneasy feeling that people were talking about him behind his back
they eyed him differently somehow
as though theyd heard somethingsome lying rumour
armitage
supposing armitage had talked
hed avoided people after thatwithdrawn into himself
unpleasant to feel that people were discussing you
and all so long ago
soso purposeless now
leslie had faded into the distance and arthur richmond too
nothing of what had happened seemed to matter anymore
it made life lonely though
hed taken to shunning his old army friends
if armitage had talked theyd know about it
and nowthis eveninga hidden voice had blared out that old hidden story
had he dealt with it all right
kept a stiff upper lip
betrayed the right amount of feelingindignation disgustbut no guilt no discomfiture
difficult to tell
surely nobody could have taken the accusation seriously
there had been a pack of other nonsense just as farfetched
that charming girlthe voice had accused her of drowning a child
idiotic
some madman throwing crazy accusations about
emily brent tooactually a niece of old tom brent of the regiment
it had accused her of murder
any one could see with half an eye that the woman was as pious as could bethe kind that was hand and glove with parsons
damned curious business the whole thing
crazy nothing less
ever since they had got herewhen was that
why damn it it was only this afternoon
seemed a good bit longer than that
he thought i wonder when we shall get away againtomorrow of course when the motorboat came from the mainland
funny just this minute he didnt want much to get away from the island  to go back to the mainland back to his little house back to all the troubles and worries
through the open window he could hear the waves breaking on the rocksa little louder now than earlier in the evening
wind was getting up too
he thought peaceful sound
peaceful place
he thought best of an island is once you get thereyou cant go any farther  youve come to the end of things
he knew suddenly that he didnt want to leave the island
vivera claythorne lay in bed wide awake staring up at the ceiling
the light beside her was on
she was frightened of the dark
she was thinkinghugo  hugo  why do i feel youre so near to me tonight
 somewhere quite close
where is he really
i dont know
i never shall know
he just went awayright awayout of my lifeit was no good trying not to think of hugo
he was close to her
she had to think of himto remember
cornwall
the black rocks the smooth yellow sand
mrs hamilton stout goodhumoured
cyril whining a little always pulling at her hand
i want to swim out to the rock miss claythorne
why cant i swim out to the rocklooking upmeeting hugos eyes watching her
the evenings after cyril was in bed
come out for a stroll miss claythornei think perhaps i willthe decorous stroll down to the beach
the moonlightthe soft atlantic air
and then hugos arms round her
i love you
i love you
you know i love you verayes she knew
or thought she knew
i cant ask you to marry me
ive not got a penny
its all i can do to keep myself
queer you know once for three months i had the chance of being a rich man to look forward to
cyril wasnt born until three months after maurice died
if hed been a girlif the child had been a girl hugo would have come into everything
hed been disappointed he admitted
i hadnt built on it of course
but it was a bit of a knock
oh well lucks luck
cyrils a nice kid
im awfully fond of him and he was fond of him too
always ready to play games or amuse his small nephew
no rancour in hugos nature
cyril wasnt really strong
a puny childno stamina
the kind of child perhaps who wouldnt live to grow up
and then
miss claythorne why cant i swim to the rockirritating whiney repetition
its too far cyrilbut miss claythornevera got up
she went to the dressing table and swallowed three aspirins
she thoughti wish i had some proper sleeping stuffshe thoughtif i were doing away with myself id take an overdose of veronalsomething like thatnot cyanideshe shuddered as she remembered anthony marstons convulsed purple face
as she passed the mantelpiece she looked up at the framed doggerel
ten little soldier boys went out to dineone choked his little self and then there were nineshe thought to herselfits horriblejust like us this eveningwhy had anthony marston wanted to die
she didnt want to die
she couldnt imagine wanting to die
death was forthe other people
sixidr armstrong was dreaming
it was very hot in the operating room
surely theyd got the temperature too high
the sweat was rolling down his face
his hands were clammy
difficult to hold the scalpel firmly
how beautifully sharp it was
easy to do a murder with a knife like that
and of course he was doing a murder
the womans body looked different
it had been a large unwieldy body
this was a spare meagre body
and the face was hidden
who was it that he had to kill
he couldnt remember
but he must know
should he ask sister
sister was watching him
no he couldnt ask her
she was suspicious he could see that
but who was it on the operating table
they shouldnt have covered up the face like that
if he could only see the face
ah
that was better
a young probationer was pulling off the handkerchief
emily brent of course
it was emily brent that he had to kill
how malicious her eyes were
her lips were moving
what was she saying
in the midst of life we are in deathshe was laughing now
no nurse dont put the handkerchief back
ive got to see
ive got to give the anaesthetic
wheres the ether
i must have brought the ether with me
what have you done with the ether sister
chÃ¢teauneufdupape
yes that will do quite as well
take the handkerchief away nurse
of course
i knew it all the time
its anthony marston
his face is purple and convulsed
but hes not deadhes laughing
i tell you hes laughing
hes shaking the operating table
look out man look out
nurse steady itsteady itwith a start dr armstrong woke up
it was morning
sunlight was pouring into the room
and someone was leaning over himshaking him
it was rogers
rogers with a white face saying doctordoctordr armstrong woke up completely
he sat up in bed
he said sharplywhat is itits the wife doctor
i cant get her to wake
my god
i cant get her to wake
andand she dont look right to medr armstrong was quick and efficient
he wrapped himself in his dressing gown and followed rogers
he bent over the bed where the woman was lying peacefully on her side
he lifted the cold hand raised the eyelid
it was some few minutes before he straightened himself and turned from the bed
rogers whisperedissheis shehe passed a tongue over dry lips
armstrong nodded
yes shes gonehis eyes rested thoughtfully on the man before him
then they went to the table by the bed to the washstand then back to the sleeping woman
rogers saidwas itwas iter eart doctordr armstrong was a minute or two before replying
then he saidwhat was her health like normallyrogers saidshe was a bit rheumatickyany doctor been attending her recentlydoctor rogers stared
not been to a doctor for yearsneither of usyoud no reason to believe she suffered from heart troubleno doctor
i never knew of anythingarmstrong saiddid she sleep wellnow rogers eyes evaded his
the mans hands came together and turned and twisted uneasily
he mutteredshe didnt sleep extra wellnothe doctor said sharplydid she take things to make her sleeprogers stared at him surprised
take things
to make her sleep
not that i knew of
im sure she didntarmstrong went over to the washstand
there were a certain number of bottles on it
hair lotion lavender water cascara glycerine of cucumber for the hands a mouthwash toothpaste and some ellimans
rogers helped by pulling out the drawers of the dressing table
from there they moved on to the chest of drawers
but there was no sign of sleeping draughts or tablets
rogers saidshe didnt have nothing last night sir except what you gave heriiwhen the gong sounded for breakfast at nine oclock it found everyone up and awaiting the summons
general macarthur and the judge had been pacing the terrace outside exchanging desultory comments on the political situation
vera claythorne and philip lombard had been up to the summit of the island behind the house
there they had discovered william henry blore standing staring at the mainland
he saidno sign of that motorboat yet
ive been watching for itvera said smilingdevons a sleepy county
things are usually latephilip lombard was looking the other way out to sea
he said abruptlywhat dyou think of the weatherglancing up at the sky blore remarkedlooks all right to melombard pursed up his mouth into a whistle
he saidit will come on to blow before the days outblore saidsquallyehfrom below them came the boom of a gong
philip lombard saidbreakfast
well i could do with someas they went down the steep slope blore said to lombard in a ruminating voiceyou know it beats mewhy that young fellow wanted to do himself in
ive been worrying about it all nightvera was a little ahead
lombard hung back slightly
he saidgot any alternative theoryid want some proof
motive to begin with
welloff i should say he wasemily brent came out of the drawing room window to meet them
she said sharplyis the boat comingnot yet said vera
they went into breakfast
there was a vast dish of eggs and bacon on the sideboard and tea and coffee
rogers held the door open for them to pass in then shut it from the outside
emily brent saidthat man looks ill this morningdr armstrong who was standing by the window cleared his throat
he saidyou must excuse anyershortcomings this morning
rogers has had to do the best he can for breakfast singlehanded
mrs rogers hasernot been able to carry on this morningemily brent said sharplywhats the matter with the womandr armstrong said easilylet us start our breakfast
the eggs will be cold
afterwards there are several matters i want to discuss with you allthey took the hint
plates were filled coffee and tea was poured
the meal began
discussion of the island was by mutual consent tabooed
they spoke instead in a desultory fashion of current events
the news from abroad events in the world of sport the latest reappearance of the loch ness monster
then when plates were cleared dr armstrong moved back his chair a little cleared his throat importantly and spoke
he saidi thought it better to wait until you had had your breakfast before telling you of a sad piece of news
mrs rogers died in her sleepthere were startled and shocked ejaculations
vera exclaimedhow awful
two deaths on this island since we arrivedmr justice wargrave his eyes narrowed said in his small precise clear voicehmvery remarkablewhat was the cause of deatharmstrong shrugged his shoulders
impossible to say offhandthere must be an autopsyi certainly couldnt give a certificate
i have no knowledge whatsoever of the womans state of healthvera saidshe was a very nervouslooking creature
and she had a shock last night
it might have been heart failure i supposedr armstrong said drylyher heart certainly failed to beatbut what caused it to fail is the questionone word fell from emily brent
it fell hard and clear into the listening group
conscience she said
armstrong turned to her
what exactly do you mean by that miss brentemily brent her lips tight and hard saidyou all heard
she was accused together with her husband of having deliberately murdered her former employeran old ladyand you thinkemily brent saidi think that the accusation was true
you all saw her last night
she broke down completely and fainted
the shock of having her wickedness brought home to her was too much for her
she literally died of feardr armstrong shook his head doubtfully
it is a possible theory he said
one cannot adopt it without more exact knowledge of her state of health
if there was cardiac weaknessemily brent said quietlycall it if you prefer an act of godeveryone looked shocked
mr blore said uneasilythats carrying things a bit far miss brentshe looked at them with shining eyes
her chin went up
she saidyou regard it as impossible that a sinner should be struck down by the wrath of god
i do notthe judge stroked his chin
he murmured in a slightly ironic voicemy dear lady in my experience of illdoing providence leaves the work of conviction and chastisement to us mortalsand the process is often fraught with difficulties
there are no short cutsemily brent shrugged her shoulders
blore said sharplywhat did she have to eat and drink last night after she went up to bedarmstrong saidnothingshe didnt take anything
a cup of tea
a drink of water
ill bet you she had a cup of tea
that sort always doesrogers assures me she had nothing whatsoeverah said blore
but he might say sohis tone was so significant that the doctor looked at him sharply
philip lombard saidso thats your ideablore said aggressivelywell why not
we all heard that accusation last night
may be sheer moonshinejust plain lunacy
on the other hand it may not
allow for the moment that its true
rogers and his missus polished off that old lady
well where does that get you
theyve been feeling quite safe and happy about itvera interrupted
in a low voice she saidno i dont think mrs rogers ever felt safeblore looked slightly annoyed at the interruption
just like a woman his glance said
he resumedthats as may be
anyway theres no active danger to them as far as they know
then last night some unknown lunatic spills the beans
what happens
the woman cracksshe goes to pieces
notice how her husband hung over her as she was coming round
not all husbandly solicitude
not on your life
he was like a cat on hot bricks
scared out of his life as to what she might say
and theres the position for you
theyve done a murder and got away with it
but if the whole things going to be raked up whats going to happen
ten to one the woman will give the show away
she hasnt got the nerve to stand up and brazen it out
shes a living danger to her husband thats what she is
hes all right
hell lie with a straight face till kingdom comesbut he cant be sure of her
and if she goes to pieces his necks in danger
so he slips something into a cup of tea and makes sure that her mouth is shut permanentlyarmstrong said slowlythere was no empty cup by her bedsidethere was nothing there at all
i lookedblore snorted
of course there wouldnt be
first thing hed do when shed drunk it would be to take that cup and saucer away and wash it up carefullythere was a pause
then general macarthur said doubtfullyit may be so
but i should hardly think it possible that a man would do thatto his wifeblore gave a short laugh
he saidwhen a mans necks in danger he doesnt stop to think too much about sentimentthere was a pause
before any one could speak the door opened and rogers came in
he said looking from one to the otheris there anything more i can get youmr justice wargrave stirred a little in his chair
he askedwhat time does the motorboat usually come overbetween seven and eight sir
sometimes its a bit after eight
dont know what fred narracott can be doing this morning
if hes ill hed send his brotherphilip lombard saidwhats the time nowten minutes to ten sirlombards eyebrows rose
he nodded slowly to himself
rogers waited a minute or two
general macarthur spoke suddenly and explosivelysorry to hear about your wife rogers
doctors just been telling usrogers inclined his head
yes sir
thank you sirhe took up the empty bacon dish and went out
again there was a silence
iiion the terrace outside philip lombard saidabout this motorboatblore looked at him
blore nodded his head
he saidi know what youre thinking mr lombard
ive asked myself the same question
motorboat ought to have been here nigh on two hours ago
it hasnt come
whyfound the answer asked lombard
its not an accidentthats what i say
its part and parcel of the whole business
its all bound up togetherphilip lombard saidit wont come you thinka voice spoke behind hima testy impatient voice
the motorboats not coming it said
blore turned his square shoulder slightly and viewed the last speaker thoughtfully
you think not too generalgeneral macarthur said sharplyof course it wont come
were counting on the motorboat to take us off the island
thats the meaning of the whole business
were not going to leave the island none of us will ever leave  its the end you seethe end of everythinghe hesitated then he said in a low strange voicethats peacereal peace
to come to the endnot to have to go on  yes peacehe turned abruptly and walked away
along the terrace then down the slope towards the seaobliquelyto the end of the island where loose rocks went out into the water
he walked a little unsteadily like a man who was only half awake
blore saidthere goes another one whos barmy
looks as though itll end with the whole lot going that wayphilip lombard saidi dont fancy you will blorethe exinspector laughed
it would take a lot to send me off my head he added dryly and i dont think youll be going that way either mr lombardphilip lombard saidi feel quite sane at the minute thank youivdr armstrong came out on to the terrace
he stood there hesitating
to his left were blore and lombard
to his right was wargrave slowly pacing up and down his head bent down
armstrong after a moment of indecision turned towards the latter
but at that moment rogers came quickly out of the house
could i have a word with you sir pleasearmstrong turned
he was startled at what he saw
rogers face was working
its colour was greyish green
his hands shook
it was such a contrast to his restraint of a few minutes ago that armstrong was quite taken aback
please sir if i could have a word with you
inside sirthe doctor turned back and reentered the house with the frenzied butler
he saidwhats the matter man pull yourself togetherin here sir come in herehe opened the dining room door
the doctor passed in
rogers followed him and shut the door behind him
well said armstrong what is itthe muscles of rogers throat were working
he was swallowing
he jerked outtheres things going on sir that i dont understandarmstrong said sharplythings
what thingsyoull think im crazy sir
youll say it isnt anything
but its got to be explained sir
its got to be explained
because it doesnt make any sensewell man tell me what it is
dont go on talking in riddlesrogers swallowed again
he saidits those little figures sir
in the middle of the table
the little china figures
ten of them there were
ill swear to that ten of themarmstrong saidyes ten
we counted them last night at dinnerrogers came nearer
thats just it sir
last night when i was clearing up there wasnt but nine sir
i noticed it and thought it queer
but thats all i thought
and now sir this morning
i didnt notice when i laid the breakfast
i was upset and all that
but now sir when i came to clear away
see for yourself if you dont believe me
theres only eight sir
only eight
it doesnt make sense does it
only eightseveniafter breakfast emily brent had suggested to vera claythorne that they should walk to the summit again and watch for the boat
vera had acquiesced
the wind had freshened
small white crests were appearing on the sea
there were no fishing boats outand no sign of the motorboat
the actual village of sticklehaven could not be seen only the hill above it a jutting out cliff of red rock concealed the actual little bay
emily brent saidthe man who brought us out yesterday seemed a dependable sort of person
it is really very odd that he should be so late this morningvera did not answer
she was fighting down a rising feeling of panic
she said to herself angrilyyou must keep cool
this isnt like you
youve always had excellent nervesaloud she said after a minute or twoi wish he would come
ii want to get awayemily brent said drylyive no doubt we all dovera saidits all so extraordinary  there seems nono meaning in it allthe elderly woman beside her said brisklyim very annoyed with myself for being so easily taken in
really that letter is absurd when one comes to examine it
but i had no doubts at the timenone at allvera murmured mechanically i suppose notone takes things for granted too much said emily brent
vera drew a deep shuddering breath
she saiddo you really thinkwhat you said at breakfastbe a little more precise my dear
to what in particular are you referringvera said in a low voicedo you really think that rogers and his wife did away with that old ladyemily brent gazed thoughtfully out to sea
then she saidpersonally i am quite sure of it
what do you thinki dont know what to thinkemily brent saideverything goes to support the idea
the way the woman fainted
and the man dropped the coffee tray remember
then the way he spoke about itit didnt ring true
oh yes im afraid they did itvera saidthe way she lookedscared of her own shadow
ive never seen a woman look so frightened  she must have been always haunted by itmiss brent murmuredi remember a text that hung in my nursery as a child
âbe sure thy sin will find thee out its very true that
be sure thy sin will find thee outvera scrambled to her feet
she saidbut miss brentmiss brentin that caseyes my dearthe others
what about the othersi dont quite understand youall the other accusationstheythey werent true
but if its true about the rogerses she stopped unable to make her chaotic thought clear
emily brents brow which had been frowning perplexedly cleared
she saidah i understand you now
well there is that mr lombard
he admits to having abandoned twenty men to their deathsvera said they were only nativesemily brent said sharplyblack or white they are our brothersvera thoughtour black brothersour black brothers
oh im going to laugh
im hysterical
im not myselfemily brent continued thoughtfully
of course some of the other accusations were very far fetched and ridiculous
against the judge for instance who was only doing his duty in his public capacity
and the exscotland yard man
my own case tooshe paused and then went onnaturally considering the circumstances i was not going to say anything last night
it was not a fit subject to discuss before gentlemennovera listened with interest
miss brent continued serenely
beatrice taylor was in service with me
not a nice girlas i found out too late
i was very much deceived in her
she had nice manners and was very clean and willing
i was very pleased with her
of course all that was the sheerest hypocrisy
she was a loose girl with no morals
disgusting
it was some time before i found out that she was what they call âin trouble she paused her delicate nose wrinkling itself in distaste
it was a great shock to me
her parents were decent folk too who had brought her up very strictly
im glad to say they did not condone her behaviourvera said staring at miss brentwhat happenednaturally i did not keep her an hour under my roof
no one shall ever say that i condoned immoralityvera said in a lower voicewhat happenedto hermiss brent saidthe abandoned creature not content with having one sin on her conscience committed a still graver sin
she took her own lifevera whispered horrorstruckshe killed herselfyes she threw herself into the riververa shivered
she stared at the calm delicate profile of miss brent
she saidwhat did you feel like when you knew shed done that
werent you sorry
didnt you blame yourselfemily brent drew herself up
i
i had nothing with which to reproach myselfvera saidbut if yourhardnessdrove her to itemily brent said sharplyher own actionher own sinthat was what drove her to it
if she had behaved like a decent modest young woman none of this would have happenedshe turned her face to vera
there was no selfreproach no uneasiness in those eyes
they were hard and selfrighteous
emily brent sat on the summit of soldier island encased in her own armour of virtue
the little elderly spinster was no longer slightly ridiculous to vera
suddenlyshe was terrible
iidr armstrong came out of the dining room and once more came out on the terrace
the judge was sitting in a chair now gazing placidly out to sea
lombard and blore were over to the left smoking but not talking
as before the doctor hesitated for a moment
his eye rested speculatively on mr justice wargrave
he wanted to consult with someone
he was conscious of the judges acute logical brain
but nevertheless he wavered
mr justice wargrave might have a good brain but he was an elderly man
at this juncture armstrong felt what was needed was a man of action
he made up his mind
lombard can i speak to you for a minutephilip started
of coursethe two men left the terrace
they strolled down the slope towards the water
when they were out of earshot armstrong saidi want a consultationlombards eyebrows went up
he saidmy dear fellow ive no medical knowledgeno no i mean as to the general situationoh thats differentarmstrong saidfrankly what do you think of the positionlombard reflected a minute
then he saidits rather suggestive isnt itwhat are your ideas on the subject of that woman
do you accept blores theoryphilip puffed smoke into the air
he saidits perfectly feasibletaken aloneexactlyarmstrongs tone sounded relieved
philip lombard was no fool
the latter went onthat is accepting the premise that mr and mrs rogers have successfully got away with murder in their time
and i dont see why they shouldnt
what do you think they did exactly
poisoned the old ladyarmstrong said slowlyit might be simpler than that
i asked rogers this morning what this miss brady had suffered from
his answer was enlightening
i dont need to go into medical details but in a certain form of cardiac trouble amyl nitrite is used
when an attack comes on an ampoule of amyl nitrite is broken and it is inhaled
if amyl nitrite were withheldwell the consequences might easily be fatalphilip lombard said thoughtfullyas simple as that
it must have beenrather temptingthe doctor nodded
yes no positive action
no arsenic to obtain and administernothing definitejustnegation
and rogers hurried through the night to fetch a doctor and they both felt confident that no one could ever knowand even if any one knew nothing could ever be proved against them added philip lombard
he frowned suddenly
of coursethat explains a good dealarmstrong said puzzledi beg your pardonlombard saidi meanit explains soldier island
there are crimes that cannot be brought home to their perpetrators
instance the rogerses
another instance old wargrave who committed his murder strictly within the lawarmstrong said sharply you believe that storyphilip lombard smiled
oh yes i believe it
wargrave murdered edward seton all right murdered him as surely as if hed stuck a stiletto through him
but he was clever enough to do it from the judges seat in wig and gown
so in the ordinary way you cant bring his little crime home to hima sudden flash passed like lightning through armstrongs mind
murder in hospital
murder on the operating table
safeyes safe as housesphilip lombard was sayinghencemr
owenhencesoldier islandarmstrong drew a deep breath
now were getting down to it
whats the real purpose of getting us all herephilip lombard saidwhat do you thinkarmstrong said abruptlylets go back a minute to this womans death
what are the possible theories
rogers killed her because he was afraid she would give the show away
second possibility she lost her nerve and took an easy way out herselfphilip lombard saidsuicide ehwhat do you say to thatlombard saidit could have beenyesif it hadnt been for marstons death
two suicides within twelve hours is a little too much to swallow
and if you tell me that anthony marston a young bull with no nerves and precious little brains got the wind up over having mowed down a couple of kids and deliberately put himself out of the waywell the ideas laughable
and anyway how did he get hold of the stuff
from all ive ever heard potassium cyanide isnt the kind of stuff you take about with you in your waistcoat pocket
but thats your line of countryarmstrong saidnobody in their senses carries potassium cyanide
it might be done by someone who was going to take a wasps nestthe ardent gardener or landowner in fact
again not anthony marston
it strikes me that that cyanide is going to need a bit of explaining
either anthony marston meant to do away with himself before he came here and therefore came preparedor elsearmstrong prompted him
or elsephilip lombard grinned
why make me say it
when its on the tip of your own tongue
anthony marston was murdered of courseiiidr armstrong drew a deep breath
and mrs rogerslombard said slowlyi could believe in anthonys suicide with difficulty if it werent for mrs rogers
i could believe in mrs rogers suicide easily if it werent for anthony marston
i can believe that rogers put his wife out of the wayif it were not for the unexpected death of anthony marston
but what we need is a theory to explain two deaths following rapidly on each otherarmstrong saidi can perhaps give you some help towards that theoryand he repeated the facts that rogers had given him about the disappearance of the two little china figures
lombard saidyes little china figures  there were certainly ten last night at dinner
and now there are eight you saydr armstrong recitedten little soldier boys going out to dineone went and choked himself and then there were nine
nine little soldier boys sat up very lateone overslept himself and then there were eightthe two men looked at each other
philip lombard grinned and flung away his cigarette
fits too damned well to be a coincidence
anthony marston dies of asphyxiation or choking last night after dinner and mother rogers oversleeps herself with a vengeanceand therefore said armstrong
lombard took him up
and therefore another kind of soldier
the unknown soldier
x
mr owen
u n owen
one unknown lunatic at largeah armstrong breathed a sigh of relief
you agree
but you see what it involves
rogers swore that there was no one but ourselves and he and his wife on the islandrogers is wrong
or possibly rogers is lyingarmstrong shook his head
i dont think hes lying
the mans scared
hes scared nearly out of his sensesphilip lombard nodded
he saidno motorboat this morning
that fits in
mr owens little arrangements again to the fore
soldier island is to be isolated until mr owen has finished his jobarmstrong had gone pale
he saidyou realizethe man must be a raving maniacphilip lombard said and there was a new ring in his voicetheres one thing mr owen didnt realizewhats thatthis islands more or less a bare rock
we shall make short work of searching it
well soon ferret out u n owen esqdr armstrong said warninglyhell be dangerousphilip lombard laughed
dangerous
whos afraid of the big bad wolf
ill be dangerous when i get hold of himhe paused and saidwed better rope in blore to help us
hell be a good man in a pinch
better not tell the women
as for the others the generals gaga i think and old wargraves forte is masterly inactivity
the three of us can attend to this jobeightiblore was easily roped in
he expressed immediate agreement with their arguments
what youve said about those china figures sir makes all the difference
thats crazy that is
theres only one thing
you dont think this owens idea might be to do the job by proxy as it wereexplain yourself manwell i mean like this
after the racket last night this young marston gets the wind up and poisons himself
and rogers he gets the wind up too and bumps off his wife
all according to unos planarmstrong shook his head
he stressed the point about the cyanide
blore agreed
yes id forgotten that
not a natural thing to be carrying about with you
but how did it get into his drink sirlombard saidive been thinking about that
marston had several drinks that night
between the time he had his last one and the time he finished the one before it there was quite a gap
during that time his glass was lying about on some table or other
i thinkthough i cant be sure it was on the little table near the window
the window was open
somebody could have slipped a dose of the cyanide into the glassblore said unbelievinglywithout our all seeing him sirlombard said drylywe were allrather concerned elsewherearmstrong said slowlythats true
wed all been attacked
we were walking about moving about the room
arguing indignant intent on our own business
i think it could have been doneblore shrugged his shoulders
fact is it must have been done
now then gentlemen lets make a start
nobodys got a revolver by any chance
i suppose thats too much to hope forlombard saidive got one he patted his pocket
blores eyes opened very wide
he said in an overcasual tonealways carry that about with you sirlombard saidusually
ive been in some tight places you knowoh said blore and added well youve probably never been in a tighter place than you are today
if theres a lunatic hiding on this island hes probably got a young arsenal on himto say nothing of a knife or dagger or twoarmstrong coughed
you may be wrong there blore
many homicidal lunatics are very quiet unassuming people
delightful fellowsblore saidi dont feel this one is going to be of that kind dr armstrongiithe three men started on their tour of the island
it proved unexpectedly simple
on the northwest side towards the coast the cliffs fell sheer to the sea below their surface unbroken
on the rest of the island there were no trees and very little cover
the three men worked carefully and methodically beating up and down from the highest point to the waters edge narrowly scanning the least irregularity in the rock which might point to the entrance to a cave
but there were no caves
they came at last skirting the waters edge to where general macarthur sat looking out to sea
it was very peaceful here with the lap of the waves breaking over the rocks
the old man sat very upright his eyes fixed on the horizon
he paid no attention to the approach of the searchers
his oblivion of them made one at least faintly uncomfortable
blore thought to himself tisnt naturallooks as though hed gone into a trance or somethinghe cleared his throat and said in a wouldbe conversational tonenice peaceful spot youve found for yourself sirthe general frowned
he cast a quick look over his shoulder
he saidthere is so little timeso little time
i really must insist that no one disturbs meblore said geniallywe wont disturb you
were just making a tour of the island so to speak
just wondered you know if someone might be hiding on itthe general frowned and saidyou dont understandyou dont understand at all
please go awayblore retreated
he said as he joined the other twohes crazy  its no good talking to himlombard asked with some curiositywhat did he sayblore shrugged his shoulders
something about there being no time and that he didnt want to be disturbeddr armstrong frowned
he murmuredi wonder nowiiithe search of the island was practically completed
the three men stood on the highest point looking over towards the mainland
there were no boats out
the wind was freshening
lombard saidno fishing boats out
theres a storm coming
damned nuisance you cant see the village from here
we could signal or do somethingblore saidwe might light a bonfire tonightlombard said frowningthe devil of it is that thats all probably been provided forin what way sirhow do i know
practical joke perhaps
were to be marooned here no attention is to be paid to signals etc
possibly the village has been told theres a wager on
some damn fool story anywayblore said dubiouslythink theyd swallow thatlombard said drylyits easier of belief than the truth
if the village were told that the island was to be isolated until mr
unknown owen had quietly murdered all his guestsdo you think theyd believe thatdr armstrong saidthere are moments when i cant believe it myself
and yetphilip lombard his lips curling back from his teeth saidand yetthats just it
youve said it doctorblore was gazing down into the water
he saidnobody could have clambered down here i supposearmstrong shook his head
i doubt it
its pretty sheer
and where could he hideblore saidthere might be a hole in the cliff
if we had a boat now we could row round the islandlombard saidif we had a boat wed all be halfway to the mainland by nowtrue enough sirlombard said suddenlywe can make sure of this cliff
theres only one place where there could be a recessjust a little to the right below here
if you fellows can get hold of a rope you can let me down to make sureblore saidmight as well be sure
though it seems absurdon the face of it
ill see if i can get hold of somethinghe started off briskly down to the house
lombard stared up at the sky
the clouds were beginning to mass themselves together
the wind was increasing
he shot a sideways look at armstrong
he saidyoure very silent doctor
what are you thinkingarmstrong said slowlyi was wondering exactly how mad old macarthur wasivvera had been restless all the morning
she had avoided emily brent with a kind of shuddering aversion
miss brent herself had taken a chair just round the corner of the house so as to be out of the wind
she sat there knitting
every time vera thought of her she seemed to see a pale drowned face with seaweed entangled in the hair  a face that had once been prettyimpudently pretty perhapsand which was now beyond the reach of pity or terror
and emily brent placid and righteous sat knitting
on the main terrace mr justice wargrave sat huddled in a porters chair
his head was poked down well into his neck
when vera looked at him she saw a man standing in the docka young man with fair hair and blue eyes and a bewildered frightened face
edward seton
and in imagination she saw the judges old hands put the black cap on his head and begin to pronounce sentence
after a while vera strolled slowly down to the sea
she walked along towards the extreme end of the island where an old man sat staring out to the horizon
general macarthur stirred at her approach
his head turnedthere was a queer mixture of questioning and apprehension in his look
it startled her
he stared intently at her for a minute or two
she thought to herselfhow queer
its almost as though he knewhe saidah its you
youve comevera sat down beside him
she saiddo you like sitting here looking out to seahe nodded his head gently
yes he said
its pleasant
its a good place i think to waitto wait said vera sharply
what are you waiting forhe said gentlythe end
but i think you know that dont you
its true isnt it
were all waiting for the endshe said unsteadilywhat do you meangeneral macarthur said gravelynone of us are going to leave the island
thats the plan
you know it of course perfectly
what perhaps you cant understand is the reliefvera said wonderinglythe reliefhe saidyes
of course youre very young  you havent got to that yet
but it does come
the blessed relief when you know that youve done with it allthat you havent got to carry the burden any longer
youll feel that too somedayvera said hoarselyi dont understand youher fingers worked spasmodically
she felt suddenly afraid of this quiet old soldier
he said musinglyyou see i loved leslie
i loved her very muchvera said questioninglywas leslie your wifeyes my wife  i loved herand i was very proud of her
she was so prettyand so gayhe was silent for a minute or two then he saidyes i loved leslie
thats why i did itvera saidyou mean and paused
general macarthur nodded his head gently
its not much good denying it nownot when were all going to die
i sent richmond to his death
i suppose in a way it was murder
curious
murderand ive always been such a lawabiding man
but it didnt seem like that at the time
i had no regrets
âserves him damned well rightthats what i thought
but afterwardsin a hard voice vera saidwell afterwardshe shook his head vaguely
he looked puzzled and a little distressed
i dont know
idont know
it was all different you see
i dont know if leslie ever guessed  i dont think so
but you see i didnt know about her anymore
shed gone far away where i couldnt reach her
and then she diedand i was alonevera saidalonealone and the echo of her voice came back to her from the rocks
general macarthur saidyoull be glad too when the end comesvera got up
she said sharplyi dont know what you meanhe saidi know my child
i knowyou dont
you dont understand at allgeneral macarthur looked out to sea again
he seemed unconscious of her presence behind him
he said very gently and softlyleslie vwhen blore returned from the house with a rope coiled over his arm he found armstrong where he had left him staring down into the depths
blore said breathlesslywheres mr lombardarmstrong said carelesslygone to test some theory or other
hell be back in a minute
look here blore im worriedi should say we were all worriedthe doctor waved an impatient hand
of courseof course
i dont mean it that way
im thinking of old macarthurwhat about him sirdr armstrong said grimlywhat were looking for is a madman
what price macarthurblore said incredulouslyyou mean hes homicidalarmstrong said doubtfullyi shouldnt have said so
not for a minute
but of course im not a specialist in mental diseases
i havent really had any conversation with himi havent studied him from that point of viewblore said doubtfullygaga yes
but i wouldnt have saidarmstrong cut in with a slight effort as of a man who pulls himself together
youre probably right
damn it all there must be someone hiding on the island
ah
here comes lombardthey fastened the rope carefully
lombard saidill help myself all i can
keep a lookout for a sudden strain on the ropeafter a minute or two while they stood together watching lombards progress blore saidclimbs like a cat doesnt hethere was something odd in his voice
dr armstrong saidi should think he must have done some mountaineering in his timemaybethere was a silence and the exinspector saidfunny sort of cove altogether
dyou know what i thinkwhathes a wrong unarmstrong said doubtfullyin what wayblore grunted
then he saidi dont knowexactly
but i wouldnt trust him a yarddr armstrong saidi suppose hes led an adventurous lifeblore saidi bet some of his adventures have had to be kept pretty dark he paused and then went on did you happen to bring a revolver along with you doctorarmstrong stared
me
good lord no
why should iblore saidwhy did mr lombardarmstrong said doubtfullyi supposehabitblore snorted
a sudden pull came on the rope
for some moments they had their hands full
presently when the strain relaxed blore saidthere are habits and habits
mr lombard takes a revolver to out of the way places right enough and a primus and a sleepingbag and a supply of bug powder no doubt
but habit wouldnt make him bring the whole outfit down here
its only in books people carry revolvers around as a matter of coursedr armstrong shook his head perplexedly
they leaned over and watched lombards progress
his search was thorough and they could see at once that it was futile
presently he came up over the edge of the cliff
he wiped the perspiration from his forehead
well he said
were up against it
its the house or nowherevithe house was easily searched
they went through the few outbuildings first and then turned their attention to the building itself
mrs rogers yard measure discovered in the kitchen dresser assisted them
but there were no hidden spaces left unaccounted for
everything was plain and straightforward a modern structure devoid of concealments
they went through the ground floor first
as they mounted to the bedroom floor they saw through the landing window rogers carrying out a tray of cocktails to the terrace
philip lombard said lightlywonderful animal the good servant
carries on with an impassive countenancearmstrong said appreciativelyrogers is a firstclass butler ill say that for himblore saidhis wife was a pretty good cook too
that dinnerlast nightthey turned in to the first bedroom
five minutes later they faced each other on the landing
no one hidingno possible hiding place
blore saidtheres a little stair heredr armstrong saidit leads up to the servants roomblore saidthere must be a place under the rooffor cisterns water tank etc
its the best chanceand the only oneand it was then as they stood there that they heard the sound from above
a soft furtive footfall overhead
they all heard it
armstrong grasped blores arm
lombard held up an admonitory finger
quietlistenit came againsomeone moving softly furtively overhead
armstrong whisperedhes actually in the bedroom itself
the room where mrs rogers body isblore whispered backof course
best hidingplace he could have chosen
nobody likely to go there
now thenquiet as you canthey crept stealthily upstairs
on the little landing outside the door of the bedroom they paused again
yes someone was in the room
there was a faint creak from within
blore whisperednowhe flung open the door and rushed in the other two close behind him
then all three stopped dead
rogers was in the room his hands full of garments
viiblore recovered himself first
he saidsorryerrogers
heard someone moving about in here and thoughtwellhe stopped
rogers saidim sorry gentlemen
i was just moving my things
i take it there will be no objection if i take one of the vacant guest chambers on the floor below
the smallest roomit was to armstrong that he spoke and armstrong repliedof course
of course
get on with ithe avoided looking at the sheeted figure lying on the bed
rogers saidthank you sirhe went out of the room with his arm full of belongings and went down the stairs to the floor below
armstrong moved over to the bed and lifting the sheet looked down on the peaceful face of the dead woman
there was no fear there now
just emptiness
armstrong saidwish id got my stuff here
id like to know what drug it wasthen he turned to the other two
lets get finished
i feel it in my bones were not going to find anythingblore was wrestling with the bolts of a low manhole
he saidthat chap moves damned quietly
a minute or two ago we saw him in the garden
none of us heard him come upstairslombard saidi suppose thats why we assumed it must be a stranger moving about up hereblore disappeared into a cavernous darkness
lombard pulled a torch from his pocket and followed
five minutes later three men stood on an upper landing and looked at each other
they were dirty and festooned with cobwebs and their faces were grim
there was no one on the island but their eight selves
nineilombard said slowlyso weve been wrongwrong all along
built up a nightmare of superstition and fantasy all because of the coincidence of two deathsarmstrong said gravelyand yet you know the argument holds
hang it all im a doctor i know something about suicides
anthony marston wasnt a suicidal typelombard said doubtfullyit couldnt i suppose have been an accidentblore snorted unconvinced
damned queer sort of accident he grunted
there was a pause then blore saidabout the woman and stopped
mrs
rogersyes
its possible isnt it that that might have been an accidentphilip lombard saidan accident
in what wayblore looked slightly embarrassed
his redbrick face grew a little deeper in hue
he said almost blurting out the wordslook here doctor you did give her some dope you knowarmstrong stared at him
dope
what do you meanlast night
you said yourself youd given her something to make her sleepoh that yes
a harmless sedativewhat was it exactlyi gave her a mild dose of trional
a perfectly harmless preparationblore grew redder still
he saidlook herenot to mince mattersyou didnt give her an overdose did youdr armstrong said angrilyi dont know what you meanblore saidits possible isnt it that you may have made a mistake
these things do happen once in a whilearmstrong said sharplyi did nothing of the sort
the suggestion is ridiculous he stopped and added in a cold biting tone or do you suggest that i gave her an overdose on purposephilip lombard said quicklylook here you two got to keep our heads
dont lets start slinging accusations aboutblore said sullenlyi only suggested the doctor had made a mistakedr armstrong smiled with an effort
he said showing his teeth in a somewhat mirthless smiledoctors cant afford to make mistakes of that kind my friendblore said deliberatelyit wouldnt be the first youve madeif that gramophone record is to be believedarmstrong went white
philip lombard said quickly and angrily to blorewhats the sense of making yourself offensive
were all in the same boat
weve got to pull together
what about your own pretty little spot of perjuryblore took a step forward his hands clenched
he said in a thick voiceperjury be damned
thats a foul lie
you may try and shut me up mr lombard but theres things i want to knowand one of them is about youlombards eyebrows rose
about meyes
i want to know why you brought a revolver down here on a pleasant social visitlombard saidyou do do youyes i do mr lombardlombard said unexpectedlyyou know blore youre not nearly such a fool as you lookthats as may be
what about that revolverlombard smiled
i brought it because i expected to run into a spot of troubleblore said suspiciouslyyou didnt tell us that last nightlombard shook his head
you were holding out on us blore persisted
in a way yes said lombard
well come on out with itlombard said slowlyi allowed you all to think that i was asked here in the same way as most of the others
thats not quite true
as a matter of fact i was approached by a little jewboymorris his name was
he offered me a hundred guineas to come down here and keep my eyes opensaid id got a reputation for being a good man in a tight placewell blore prompted impatiently
lombard said with a grinthats alldr armstrong saidbut surely he told you more than thatoh no he didnt
just shut up like a clam
i could take it or leave itthose were his words
i was hard up
i took itblore looked unconvinced
he saidwhy didnt you tell us all this last nightmy dear man lombard shrugged eloquent shoulders
how was i to know that last night wasnt exactly the eventuality i was here to cope with
i lay low and told a noncommittal storydr armstrong said shrewdlybut nowyou think differentlylombards face changed
it darkened and hardened
he saidyes
i believe now that im in the same boat as the rest of you
that hundred guineas was just mr owens little bit of cheese to get me into the trap along with the rest of youhe said slowlyfor we are in a trapill take my oath on that
mrs rogers death
tony marstons
the disappearing soldier boys on the dinner table
oh yes mr owens hand is plainly seenbut where the devil is mr owen himselfdownstairs the gong pealed a solemn call to lunch
iirogers was standing by the dining room door
as the three men descended the stairs he moved a step or two forward
he said in a low anxious voicei hope lunch will be satisfactory
there is cold ham and cold tongue and ive boiled some potatoes
and theres cheese and biscuits and some tinned fruitslombard saidsounds all right
stores are holding out thenthere is plenty of food sirof a tinned variety
the larder is very well stocked
a necessity that i should say sir on an island where one may be cut off from the mainland for a considerable periodlombard nodded
rogers murmured as he followed the three men into the dining roomit worries me that fred narracott hasnt been over today
its peculiarly unfortunate as you might sayyes said lombard peculiarly unfortunate describes it very wellmiss brent came into the room
she had just dropped a ball of wool and was carefully rewinding the end of it
as she took her seat at table she remarkedthe weather is changing
the wind is quite strong and there are white horses on the seamr justice wargrave came in
he walked with a slow measured tread
he darted quick looks from under his bushy eyebrows at the other occupants of the dining room
he saidyou have had an active morningthere was a faint malicious pleasure in his voice
vera claythorne hurried in
she was a little out of breath
she said quicklyi hope you didnt wait for me
am i lateemily brent saidyoure not the last
the general isnt here yetthey sat round the table
rogers addressed miss brent
will you begin madam or will you waitvera saidgeneral macarthur is sitting right down by the sea
i dont expect he would hear the gong there anywayshe hesitatedhes a little vague today i thinkrogers said quicklyi will go down and inform him luncheon is readydr armstrong jumped up
ill go he said
you others start lunchhe left the room
behind him he heard rogers voice
will you take cold tongue or cold ham madamiiithe five people sitting round the table seemed to find conversation difficult
outside sudden gusts of wind came up and died away
vera shivered a little and saidthere is a storm comingblore made a contribution to the discourse
he said conversationallythere was an old fellow in the train from plymouth yesterday
he kept saying a storm was coming
wonderful how they know weather these old saltsrogers went round the table collecting the meat plates
suddenly with the plates held in his hands he stopped
he said in an odd scared voicetheres somebody runningthey could all hear itrunning feet along the terrace
in that minute they knewknew without being told
as by common accord they all rose to their feet
they stood looking towards the door
dr armstrong appeared his breath coming fast
he saidgeneral macarthurdead the word burst from vera explosively
armstrong saidyes hes deadthere was a pausea long pause
seven people looked at each other and could find no words to say
ivthe storm broke just as the old mans body was borne in through the door
the others were standing in the hall
there was a sudden hiss and roar as the rain came down
as blore and armstrong passed up the stairs with their burden vera claythorne turned suddenly and went into the deserted dining room
it was as they had left it
the sweet course stood ready on the sideboard untasted
vera went up to the table
she was there a minute or two later when rogers came softly into the room
he started when he saw her
then his eyes asked a question
he saidoh miss ii just came to seein a loud harsh voice that surprised herself vera saidyoure quite right rogers
look for yourself
there are only sevenvgeneral macarthur had been laid on his bed
after making a last examination armstrong left the room and came downstairs
he found the others assembled in the drawing room
miss brent was knitting
vera claythorne was standing by the window looking out at the hissing rain
blore was sitting squarely in a chair his hands on his knees
lombard was walking restlessly up and down
at the far end of the room mr justice wargrave was sitting in a grandfather chair
his eyes were half closed
they opened as the doctor came into the room
he said in a clear penetrating voicewell doctorarmstrong was very pale
he saidno question of heart failure or anything like that
macarthur was hit with a life preserver or some such thing on the back of the heada little murmur went round but the clear voice of the judge was raised once more
did you find the actual weapon usednonevertheless you are sure of your factsi am quite suremr justice wargrave said quietlywe know now exactly where we arethere was no doubt now who was in charge of the situation
this morning wargrave had sat huddled in his chair on the terrace refraining from any overt activity
now he assumed command with the ease born of a long habit of authority
he definitely presided over the court
clearing his throat he once more spoke
this morning gentlemen whilst i was sitting on the terrace i was an observer of your activities
there could be little doubt of your purpose
you were searching the island for an unknown murdererquite right sir said philip lombard
the judge went on
you had come doubtless to the same conclusion that i hadnamely that the deaths of anthony marston and mrs rogers were neither accidental nor were they suicides
no doubt you also reached a certain conclusion as to the purpose of mr owen in enticing us to this islandblore said hoarselyhes a madman
a loonythe judge coughed
that almost certainly
but it hardly affects the issue
our main preoccupation is thisto save our livesarmstrong said in a trembling voicetheres no one on the island i tell you
no onethe judge stroked his jaw
he said gentlyin the sense you mean no
i came to that conclusion early this morning
i could have told you that your search would be fruitless
nevertheless i am strongly of the opinion that âmr
owen to give him the name he himself has adopted is on the island
very much so
given the scheme in question which is neither more nor less than the execution of justice upon certain individuals for offences which the law cannot touch there is only one way in which that scheme could be accomplished
mr owen could only come to the island in one way
it is perfectly clear
mr owen is one of usvioh no no noit was vera who burst outalmost in a moan
the judge turned a keen eye on her
he saidmy dear young lady this is no time for refusing to look facts in the face
we are all in grave danger
one of us is u n owen
and we do not know which of us
of the ten people who came to this island three are definitely cleared
anthony marston mrs rogers and general macarthur have gone beyond suspicion
there are seven of us left
of those seven one is if i may so express myself a bogus little soldier boyhe paused and looked round
do i take it that you all agreearmstrong saidits fantasticbut i suppose youre rightblore saidnot a doubt of it
and if you ask me ive a very good ideaa quick gesture of mr justice wargraves hand stopped him
the judge said quietlywe will come to that presently
at the moment all i wish to establish is that we are in agreement on the factsemily brent still knitting saidyour argument seems logical
i agree that one of us is possessed by a devilvera murmuredi cant believe it  i cantwargrave saidlombardi agree sir absolutelythe judge nodded his head in a satisfied manner
he saidnow let us examine the evidence
to begin with is there any reason for suspecting one particular person
mr blore you have i think something to sayblore was breathing hard
he saidlombards got a revolver
he didnt tell the truthlast night
he admits itphilip lombard smiled scornfully
he saidi suppose id better explain againhe did so telling the story briefly and succinctly
blore said sharplywhats to prove it
theres nothing to corroborate your storythe judge coughed
unfortunately he said we are all in that position
there is only our own word to go uponhe leaned forward
you have none of you yet grasped what a very peculiar situation this is
to my mind there is only one course of procedure to adopt
is there any one whom we can definitely eliminate from suspicion on the evidence which is in our possessiondr armstrong said quicklyi am a wellknown professional man
the mere idea that i can be suspected ofagain a gesture of the judges hand arrested a speaker before he finished his speech
mr justice wargrave said in his small clear voicei too am a wellknown person
but my dear sir that proves less than nothing
doctors have gone mad before now
judges have gone mad
so he added looking at blore have policemenlombard saidat any rate i suppose youll leave the women out of itthe judges eyebrows rose
he said in the famous acid tones that counsel knew so welldo i understand you to assert that women are not subject to homicidal manialombard said irritablyof course not
but all the same it hardly seems possiblehe stopped
mr justice wargrave still in the same thin sour voice addressed armstrong
i take it dr armstrong that a woman would have been physically capable of striking the blow that killed poor macarthurthe doctor said calmlyperfectly capablegiven a suitable instrument such as a rubber truncheon or coshit would require no undue exertion of forcenot at allmr justice wargrave wriggled his tortoiselike neck
he saidthe other two deaths have resulted from the administration of drugs
that no one will dispute is easily compassed by a person of the smallest physical strengthvera cried angrilyi think youre madhis eyes turned slowly till they rested on her
it was the dispassionate stare of a man well used to weighing humanity in the balance
she thoughthes just seeing me as aas a specimen
and the thought came to her with real surprise he doesnt like me muchin a measured tone the judge was sayingmy dear young lady do try and restrain your feelings
i am not accusing you he bowed to miss brent
i hope miss brent that you are not offended by my insistence that all of us are equally under suspicionemily brent was knitting
she did not look up
in a cold voice she saidthe idea that i should be accused of taking a fellow creatures lifenot to speak of the lives of three fellow creaturesis of course quite absurd to any one who knows anything of my character
but i quite appreciate the fact that we are all strangers to one another and that in those circumstances nobody can be exonerated without the fullest proof
there is as i have said a devil amongst usthe judge saidthen we are agreed
there can be no elimination on the ground of character or position alonelombard said what about rogersthe judge looked at him unblinkingly
what about himlombard saidwell to my mind rogers seems pretty well ruled outmr justice wargrave saidindeed and on what groundslombard saidhe hasnt got the brains for one thing
and for another his wife was one of the victimsthe judges heavy eyebrows rose once more
he saidin my time young man several people have come before me accused of the murders of their wivesand have been found guiltyoh
i agree
wife murder is perfectly possiblealmost natural lets say
but not this particular kind
i can believe in rogers killing his wife because he was scared of her breaking down and giving him away or because hed taken a dislike to her or because he wanted to link up with some nice little bit rather less long in the tooth
but i cant see him as the lunatic mr owen dealing out crazy justice and starting on his own wife for a crime they both committedmr justice wargrave saidyou are assuming hearsay to be evidence
we do not know that rogers and his wife conspired to murder their employer
that may have been a false statement made so that rogers should appear to be in the same position as ourselves
mrs rogers terror last night may have been due to the fact that she realized her husband was mentally unhingedlombard saidwell have it your own way
u n owen is one of us
no exceptions allowed
we all qualifymr justice wargrave saidmy point is that there can be no exceptions allowed on the score of character position or probability
what we must now examine is the possibility of eliminating one or more persons on the facts
to put it simply is there among us one or more persons who could not possibly have administered either cyanide to anthony marston or an overdose of sleeping draught to mrs rogers and who had no opportunity of striking the blow that killed general macarthurblores rather heavy face lit up
he leant forward
now youre talking sir he said
thats the stuff
lets go into it
as regards young marston i dont think theres anything to be done
its already been suggested that someone from outside slipped something into the dregs of his glass before he refilled it for the last time
a person actually in the room could have done that even more easily
i cant remember if rogers was in the room but any of the rest of us could certainly have done ithe paused then went onnow take the woman rogers
the people who stand out there are her husband and the doctor
either of them could have done it as easy as winkingarmstrong sprang to his feet
he was trembling
i protestthis is absolutely uncalled for
i swear that the dose i gave the woman was perfectlydr
armstrongthe small sour voice was compelling
the doctor stopped with a jerk in the middle of his sentence
the small cold voice went onyour indignation is very natural
nevertheless you must admit that the facts have got to be faced
either you or rogers could have administered a fatal dose with the greatest ease
let us now consider the position of the other people present
what chance had i had inspector blore had miss brent had miss claythorne had mr lombard of administering poison
can any one of us be completely and entirely eliminated he paused
i think notvera said angrilyi was nowhere near the woman
all of you can swear to thatmr justice wargrave waited a minute then he saidas far as my memory serves me the facts were thesewill any one please correct me if i make a misstatement
mrs rogers was lifted on to the sofa by anthony marston and mr lombard and dr armstrong went to her
he sent rogers for brandy
there was then a question raised as to where the voice we had just heard had come from
we all went into the next room with the exception of miss brent who remained in this roomalone with the unconscious womana spot of colour came into emily brents cheeks
she stopped knitting
she saidthis is outrageousthe remorseless small voice went onwhen we returned to this room you miss brent were bending over the woman on the sofaemily brent saidis common humanity a criminal offencemr justice wargrave saidi am only establishing facts
rogers then entered the room with the brandy which of course he could quite well have doctored before entering the room
the brandy was administered to the woman and shortly afterwards her husband and dr armstrong assisted her up to bed where dr armstrong gave her a sedativeblore saidthats what happened
absolutely
and that lets out the judge mr lombard myself and miss claythornehis voice was loud and jubilant
mr justice wargrave bringing a cold eye to bear upon him murmuredah but does it
we must take into account every possible eventualityblore stared
he saidi dont get youmr justice wargrave saidupstairs in her room mrs rogers is lying in bed
the sedative that the doctor has given her begins to take effect
she is vaguely sleepy and acquiescent
supposing that at that moment there is a tap on the door and someone enters bringing her shall we say a tablet or a draught with the message that âthe doctor says youre to take this do you imagine for one minute that she would not have swallowed it obediently without thinking twice about itthere was a silence
blore shifted his feet and frowned
philip lombard saidi dont believe in that story for a minute
besides none of us left this room for hours afterwards
there was marstons death and all the rest of itthe judge saidsomeone could have left his or her bedroomlaterlombard objectedbut then rogers would have been up theredr armstrong stirred
no he said
rogers went downstairs to clear up in the dining room and pantry
anyone could have gone up to the womans bedroom then without being seenemily brent saidsurely doctor the woman would have been fast asleep by then under the influence of the drug you had administeredin all likelihood yes
but it is not a certainty
until you have prescribed for a patient more than once you cannot tell their reaction to different drugs
there is sometimes a considerable period before a sedative takes effect
it depends on the personal idiosyncrasy of the patient towards that particular druglombard saidof course you would say that doctor
suits your bookehagain armstrongs face darkened with anger
but again that passionless cold little voice stopped the words on his lips
no good result can come from recrimination
facts are what we have to deal with
it is established i think that there is a possibility of such a thing as i have outlined occurring
i agree that its probability value is not high though there again it depends on who that person might have been
the appearance of miss brent or of miss claythorne on such an errand would have occasioned no surprise in the patients mind
i agree that the appearance of myself or of mr blore or of mr lombard would have been to say the least of it unusual but i still think the visit would have been received without the awakening of any real suspicionblore saidand that gets uswhereviimr justice wargrave stroking his lip and looking quite passionless and inhuman saidwe have now dealt with the second killing and have established the fact that no one of us can be completely exonerated from suspicionhe paused and went on
we come now to the death of general macarthur
that took place this morning
i will ask anyone who considers that he or she has an alibi to state it in so many words
i myself will state at once that i have no valid alibi
i spent the morning sitting on the terrace and meditating on the singular position in which we all find ourselves
i sat on that chair on the terrace for the whole morning until the gong went but there were i should imagine several periods during the morning when i was quite unobserved and during which it would have been possible for me to walk down to the sea kill the general and return to my chair
there is only my word for the fact that i never left the terrace
in the circumstances that is not enough
there must be proofblore saidi was with mr lombard and dr armstrong all the morning
theyll bear me outdr armstrong saidyou went to the house for a ropeblore saidof course i did
went straight there and straight back
you know i didarmstrong saidyou were a long timeblore turned crimson
he saidwhat the hell do you mean by that dr armstrongarmstrong repeatedi only said you were a long timehad to find it didnt i
cant lay your hands on a coil of rope all in a minutemr justice wargrave saidduring inspector blores absence were you two gentlemen togetherarmstrong said hotlycertainly
that is lombard went off for a few minutes
i remained where i waslombard said with a smilei wanted to test the possibilities of heliographing to the mainland
wanted to find the best spot
i was only absent a minute or twoarmstrong nodded
he saidthats right
not long enough to do a murder i assure youthe judge saiddid either of you two glance at your watcheswell nophilip lombard saidi wasnt wearing onethe judge said evenlya minute or two is a vague expressionhe turned his head to the upright figure with the knitting lying on her lap
miss brentemily brent saidi took a walk with miss claythorne up to the top of the island
afterwards i sat on the terrace in the sunthe judge saidi dont think i noticed you thereno i was round the corner of the house to the east
it was out of the wind thereand you sat there till lunchtimeyesmiss claythornevera answered readily and clearlyi was with miss brent early this morning
after that i wandered about a bit
then i went down and talked to general macarthurmr justice wargrave interrupted
he saidwhat time was thatvera for the first time was vague
she saidi dont know
about an hour before lunch i thinkor it might have been lessblore askedwas it after wed spoken to him or beforevera saidi dont know
hehe was very queershe shivered
in what way was he queer the judge wanted to know
vera said in a low voicehe said we were all going to diehe said he was waiting for the end
hehe frightened methe judge nodded
he saidwhat did you do nexti went back to the house
then just before lunch i went out again and up behind the house
ive been terribly restless all daymr justice wargrave stroked his chin
he saidthere remains rogers
though i doubt if his evidence will add anything to our sum of knowledgerogers summoned before the court had very little to tell
he had been busy all the morning about household duties and with the preparation of lunch
he had taken cocktails on to the terrace before lunch and had then gone up to remove his things from the attic to another room
he had not looked out of the window during the morning and had seen nothing that could have any bearing upon the death of general macarthur
he would swear definitely that there had been eight china figures upon the dining table when he laid the table for lunch
at the conclusion of rogers evidence there was a pause
mr justice wargrave cleared his throat
lombard murmured to vera claythornethe summing up will now take placethe judge saidwe have inquired into the circumstances of these three deaths to the best of our ability
whilst probability in some cases is against certain people being implicated yet we cannot say definitely that any one person can be considered as cleared of all complicity
i reiterate my positive belief that of the seven persons assembled in this room one is a dangerous and probably insane criminal
there is no evidence before us as to who that person is
all we can do at the present juncture is to consider what measures we can take for communicating with the mainland for help and in the event of help being delayed as is only too possible given the state of the weather what measures we must adopt to ensure our safety
i would ask you all to consider this carefully and to give me any suggestions that may occur to you
in the meantime i warn everybody to be upon his or her guard
so far the murderer has had an easy task since his victims have been unsuspicious
from now on it is our task to suspect each and every one amongst us
forewarned is forearmed
take no risks and be alert to danger
that is allphilip lombard murmured beneath his breaththe court will now adjourntenido you believe it vera asked
she and philip lombard sat on the windowsill of the living room
outside the rain poured down and the wind howled in great shuddering gusts against the windowpanes
philip lombard cocked his head slightly on one side before answering
then he saidyou mean do i believe that old wargrave is right when he says its one of usyesphilip lombard said slowlyits difficult to say
logically you know hes right and yetvera took the words out of his mouth
and yet it seems so incrediblephilip lombard made a grimace
the whole things incredible
but after macarthurs death theres no more doubt as to one thing
theres no question now of accidents or suicides
its definitely murder
three murders up to datevera shivered
she saidits like some awful dream
i keep feeling that things like this cant happenhe said with understandingi know
presently a tap will come on the door and early morning tea will be brought invera saidoh how i wish that could happenphilip lombard said gravelyyes but it wont
were all in the dream
and weve got to be pretty much upon our guard from now onvera said lowering her voiceifif it is one of themwhich do you think it isphilip lombard grinned suddenly
he saidi take it you are excepting our two selves
well thats all right
i know very well that im not the murderer and i dont fancy that theres anything insane about you vera
you strike me as being one of the sanest and most levelheaded girls ive come across
id stake my reputation on your sanitywith a slightly wry smile vera saidthank youhe said come now miss vera claythorne arent you going to return the complimentvera hesitated a minute then she saidyouve admitted you know that you dont hold human life particularly sacred but all the same i cant see you asas the man who dictated that gramophone recordlombard saidquite right
if i were to commit one or more murders it would be solely for what i could get out of them
this mass clearance isnt my line of country
good then well eliminate ourselves and concentrate on our five fellow prisoners
which of them is u n owen
well at a guess and with absolutely nothing to go upon id plump for wargraveoh vera sounded surprised
she thought a minute or two and then said whyhard to say exactly
but to begin with hes an old man and hes been presiding over courts of law for years
that is to say hes played god almighty for a good many months every year
that must go to a mans head eventually
he gets to see himself as all powerful as holding the power of life and deathand its possible that his brain might snap and he might want to go one step farther and be executioner and judge extraordinaryvera said slowlyyes i suppose thats possiblelombard saidwho do you plump forwithout any hesitation vera answereddr
armstronglombard gave a low whistle
the doctor eh
you know i should have put him last of allvera shook her head
oh no
two of the deaths have been poison
that rather points to a doctor
and then you cant get over the fact that the only thing we are absolutely certain mrs rogers had was the sleeping draught that he gave herlombard admittedyes thats truevera persistedif a doctor went mad it would be a long time before any one suspected
and doctors overwork and have a lot of strainphilip lombard saidyes but i doubt if he could have killed macarthur
he wouldnt have had time during that brief interval when i left himnot that is unless he fairly hared down there and back again and i doubt if hes in good enough training to do that and show no signs of itvera saidhe didnt do it then
he had an opportunity laterwhenwhen he went down to call the general to lunchphilip whistled again very softly
he saidso you think he did it then
pretty cool thing to dovera said impatientlywhat risk was there
hes the only person here with medical knowledge
he can swear the bodys been dead at least an hour and whos to contradict himphilip looked at her thoughtfully
you know he said thats a clever idea of yours
i wonderiiwho is it mr blore
thats what i want to know
who is itrogers face was working
his hands were clenched round the polishing leather that he held in his hand
exinspector blore saideh my lad thats the questionone of us is lordship said
which one
thats what i want to know
whos the fiend in uman formthat said blore is what we all would like to knowrogers said shrewdlybut youve got an idea mr blore
youve got an idea avent youi may have an idea said blore slowly
but thats a long way from being sure
i may be wrong
all i can say is that if im right the person in question is a very cool customera very cool customer indeedrogers wiped the perspiration from his forehead
he said hoarselyits like a bad dream thats what it isblore said looking at him curiouslygot any ideas yourself rogersthe butler shook his head
he said hoarselyi dont know
i dont know at all
and thats whats frightening the life out of me
to have no ideaiiidr armstrong said violentlywe must get out of herewe mustwe must
at all costsmr justice wargrave looked thoughtfully out of the smoking room window
he played with the cord of his eyeglasses
he saidi do not of course profess to be a weather prophet
but i should say that it is very unlikely that a boat could reach useven if they knew of our plightin under twentyfour hoursand even then only if the wind dropsdr armstrong dropped his head in his hands and groaned
he saidand in the meantime we may all be murdered in our bedsi hope not said mr justice wargrave
i intend to take every possible precaution against such a thing happeningit flashed across dr armstrongs mind that an old man like the judge was far more tenacious of life than a younger man would be
he had often marvelled at that fact in his professional career
here was he junior to the judge by perhaps twenty years and yet with a vastly inferior sense of selfpreservation
mr justice wargrave was thinkingmurdered in our beds
these doctors are all the samethey think in clichÃ©s
a thoroughly commonplace mindthe doctor saidthere have been three victims already remembercertainly
but you must remember that they were unprepared for the attack
we are forewarneddr armstrong said bitterlywhat can we do
sooner or lateri think said mr justice wargrave that there are several things we can doarmstrong saidweve no idea even who it can bethe judge stroked his chin and murmuredoh you know i wouldnt quite say thatarmstrong stared at him
do you mean you knowmr justice wargrave said cautiouslyas regards actual evidence such as is necessary in court i admit that i have none
but it appears to me reviewing the whole business that one particular person is sufficiently clearly indicated
yes i think soarmstrong stared at him
he saidi dont understandivmiss brent was upstairs in her bedroom
she took up her bible and went to sit by the window
she opened it
then after a minutes hesitation she set it aside and went over to the dressing table
from a drawer in it she took out a small blackcovered notebook
she opened it and began writing
a terrible thing has happened
general macarthur is dead
his cousin married elsie macpherson
there is no doubt but that he was murdered
after luncheon the judge made us a most interesting speech
he is convinced that the murderer is one of us
that means that one of us is possessed by a devil
i had already suspected that
which of us is it
they are all asking themselves that
i alone knowshe sat for some time without moving
her eyes grew vague and filmy
the pencil straggled drunkenly in her fingers
in shaking loose capitals she wrotethe murderers name is beatrice taylor
her eyes closed
suddenly with a start she awoke
she looked down at the notebook
with an angry exclamation she scored through the vague unevenly scrawled characters of the last sentence
she said in a low voicedid i write that
did i
i must be going madvthe storm increased
the wind howled against the side of the house
everyone was in the living room
they sat listlessly huddled together
and surreptitiously they watched each other
when rogers brought in the tea tray they all jumped
he saidshall i draw the curtains
it would make it more cheerful likereceiving an assent to this the curtains were drawn and the lamps turned on
the room grew more cheerful
a little of the shadow lifted
surely by tomorrow the storm would be over and someone would comea boat would arrive
vera claythorne saidwill you pour out tea miss brentthe elder woman repliedno you do it dear
that teapot is so heavy
and i have lost two skeins of my grey knitting wool
so annoyingvera moved to the tea table
there was a cheerful rattle and clink of china
normality returned
tea
bless ordinary everyday afternoon tea
philip lombard made a cheery remark
blore responded
dr armstrong told a humorous story
mr justice wargrave who ordinarily hated tea sipped approvingly
into this relaxed atmosphere came rogers
and rogers was upset
he said nervously and at randomexcuse me sir but does any one know whats become of the bathroom curtainlombards head went up with a jerk
the bathroom curtain
what the devil do you mean rogersits gone sir clean vanished
i was going round drawing all the curtains and the one in the lavbathroom wasnt there any longermr justice wargrave askedwas it there this morningoh yes sirblore saidwhat kind of a curtain was itscarlet oilsilk sir
it went with the scarlet tileslombard saidand its gonegone sirthey stared at each other
blore said heavilywellafter allwhat of it
its madbut sos everything else
anyway it doesnt matter
you cant kill anybody with an oilsilk curtain
forget about itrogers saidyes sir thank you sirhe went out shutting the door behind him
inside the room the pall of fear had fallen anew
again surreptitiously they watched each other
vidinner came was eaten and cleared away
a simple meal mostly out of tins
afterwards in the living room the strain was almost too great to be borne
at nine oclock emily brent rose to her feet
she saidim going to bedvera saidill go to bed toothe two women went up the stairs and lombard and blore came with them
standing at the top of the stairs the two men watched the women go into their respective rooms and shut the doors
they heard the sound of two bolts being shot and the turning of two keys
blore said with a grinno need to tell em to lock their doorslombard saidwell theyre all right for the night at any ratehe went down again and the other followed him
viithe four men went to bed an hour later
they went up together
rogers from the dining room where he was setting the table for breakfast saw them go up
he heard them pause on the landing above
then the judges voice spoke
i need hardly advise you gentlemen to lock your doorsblore saidand whats more put a chair under the handle
there are ways of turning locks from the outsidelombard murmuredmy dear blore the trouble with you is you know too muchthe judge said gravelygood night gentlemen
may we all meet safely in the morningrogers came out of the dining room and slipped halfway up the stairs
he saw four figures pass through four doors and heard the turning of four locks and the shooting of four bolts
he nodded his head
thats all right he muttered
he went back into the dining room
yes everything was ready for the morning
his eye lingered on the centre plaque of looking glass and the seven little china figures
a sudden grin transformed his face
he murmuredill see no one plays tricks tonight at any ratecrossing the room he locked the door to the pantry
then going through the other door to the hall he pulled the door to locked it and slipped the key into his pocket
then extinguishing the lights he hurried up the stairs and into his new bedroom
there was only one possible hiding place in it the tall wardrobe and he looked into that immediately
then locking and bolting the door he prepared for bed
he said to himselfno more chinasoldier tricks tonight
ive seen to thateleveniphilip lombard had the habit of waking at daybreak
he did so on this particular morning
he raised himself on an elbow and listened
the wind had somewhat abated but was still blowing
he could hear no sound of rain
at eight oclock the wind was blowing more strongly but lombard did not hear it
he was asleep again
at ninethirty he was sitting on the edge of his bed looking at his watch
he put it to his ear
then his lips drew back from his teeth in that curious wolflike smile characteristic of the man
he said very softlyi think the time has come to do something about thisat twentyfive minutes to ten he was tapping on the closed door of blores room
the latter opened it cautiously
his hair was tousled and his eyes were still dim with sleep
philip lombard said affablysleeping the clock round
well shows youve got an easy conscienceblore said shortlywhats the matterlombard answeredanybody called youor brought you any tea
do you know what time it isblore looked over his shoulder at a small travelling clock by his bedside
he saidtwentyfive to ten
wouldnt have believed i could have slept like that
wheres rogersphilip lombard saidits a case of echo answers wherewhat dyou mean asked the other sharply
lombard saidi mean that rogers is missing
he isnt in his room or anywhere else
and theres no kettle on and the kitchen fire isnt even litblore swore under his breath
he saidwhere the devil can he be
out on the island somewhere
wait till i get some clothes on
see if the others know anythingphilip lombard nodded
he moved along the line of closed doors
he found armstrong up and nearly dressed
mr justice wargrave like blore had to be roused from sleep
vera claythorne was dressed
emily brents room was empty
the little party moved through the house
rogers room as philip lombard had already ascertained was untenanted
the bed had been slept in and his razor and sponge and soap were wet
lombard saidhe got up all rightvera said in a low voice which she tried to make firm and assuredyou dont think heshiding somewherewaiting for uslombard saidmy dear girl im prepared to think anything of anyone
my advice is that we keep together until we find himarmstrong saidhe must be out on the island somewhereblore who had joined them dressed but still unshaved saidwheres miss brent got tothats another mysterybut as they arrived in the hall emily brent came in through the front door
she had on a mackintosh
she saidthe sea is as high as ever
i shouldnt think any boat could put out todayblore saidhave you been wandering about the island alone miss brent
dont you realize that thats an exceedingly foolish thing to doemily brent saidi assure you mr blore that i kept an extremely sharp look outblore grunted
he saidseen anything of rogersmiss brents eyebrows rose
rogers
no i havent seen him this morning
whymr justice wargrave shaved dressed and with his false teeth in position came down the stairs
he moved to the open dining room door
he saidha laid the table for breakfast i seelombard saidhe might have done that last nightthey all moved inside the room looking at the neatly set plates and cutlery
at the row of cups on the sideboard
at the felt mats placed ready for the coffee urn
it was vera who saw it first
she caught the judges arm and the grip of her athletic fingers made the old gentleman wince
she cried outthe soldiers
lookthere were only six china figures in the middle of the table
iithey found him shortly afterwards
he was in the little washhouse across the yard
he had been chopping sticks in preparation for lighting the kitchen fire
the small chopper was still in his hand
a bigger chopper a heavy affair was leaning against the doorthe metal of it stained a dull brown
it corresponded only too well with the deep wound in the back of rogers head
iiiperfectly clear said armstrong
the murderer must have crept up behind him swung the chopper once and brought it down on his head as he was bending overblore was busy on the handle of the chopper and the flour sifter from the kitchen
mr justice wargrave askedwould it have needed great force doctorarmstrong said gravelya woman could have done it if thats what you mean he gave a quick glance around
vera claythorne and emily brent had retired to the kitchen
the girl could have done it easilyshes an athletic type
in appearance miss brent is fragilelooking but that type of woman has often a lot of wiry strength
and you must remember that anyone whos mentally unhinged has a good deal of unsuspected strengththe judge nodded thoughtfully
blore rose to his knees with a sigh
he saidno fingerprints
handle was wiped afterwardsa sound of laughter was heardthey turned sharply
vera claythorne was standing in the yard
she cried out in a high shrill voice shaken with wild bursts of laughterdo they keep bees on this island
tell me that
where do we go for honey
ha
hathey stared at her uncomprehendingly
it was as though the sane wellbalanced girl had gone mad before their eyes
she went on in that high unnatural voicedont stare like that
as though you thought i was mad
its sane enough what im asking
bees hives bees
oh dont you understand
havent you read that idiotic rhyme
its up in all your bedroomsput there for you to study
we might have come here straightaway if wed had sense
seven little soldier boys chopping up sticks
and the next verse
i know the whole thing by heart i tell you
six little soldier boys playing with a hive
and thats why im askingdo they keep bees on this islandisnt it funnyisnt it damned funny she began laughing wildly again
dr armstrong strode forward
he raised his hand and struck her a flat blow on the cheek
she gasped hiccuppedand swallowed
she stood motionless a minute then she saidthank you  im all right nowher voice was once more calm and controlledthe voice of the efficient games mistress
she turned and went across the yard into the kitchen saying miss brent and i are getting you breakfast
can youbring some sticks to light the firethe marks of the doctors hand stood out red on her cheek
as she went into the kitchen blore saidwell you dealt with that all right doctorarmstrong said apologeticallyhad to
we cant cope with hysteria on the top of everything elsephilip lombard saidshes not a hysterical typearmstrong agreed
oh no
good healthy sensible girl
just the sudden shock
it might happen to anybodyrogers had chopped a certain amount of firewood before he had been killed
they gathered it up and took it into the kitchen
vera and emily brent were busy miss brent was raking out the stove
vera was cutting the rind off the bacon
emily brent saidthank you
well be as quick as we cansay half an hour to threequarters
the kettles got to boilivexinspector blore said in a low hoarse voice to philip lombardknow what im thinkingphilip lombard saidas youre just about to tell me its not worth the trouble of guessingexinspector blore was an earnest man
a light touch was incomprehensible to him
he went on heavilythere was a case in america
old gentleman and his wifeboth killed with an axe
middle of the morning
nobody in the house but the daughter and the maid
maid it was proved couldnt have done it
daughter was a respectable middleaged spinster
seemed incredible
so incredible that they acquitted her
but they never found any other explanation he paused
i thought of that when i saw the axeand then when i went into the kitchen and saw her there so neat and calm
hadnt turned a hair
that girl coming all over hystericalwell thats naturalthe sort of thing youd expectdont you think sophilip lombard said laconicallyit might beblore went on
but the other
so neat and primwrapped up in that apronmrs
rogers apron i supposesaying âbreakfast will be ready in half an hour or so if you ask me that womans as mad as a hatter
lots of elderly spinsters go that wayi dont mean go in for homicide on the grand scale but go queer in their heads
unfortunately its taken her this way
religious maniathinks shes gods instrument something of that kind
she sits in her room you know reading her biblephilip lombard sighed and saidthats hardly proof positive of an unbalanced mentality blorebut blore went on ploddingly perseveringlyand then she was outin her mackintosh said shed been down to look at the seathe other shook his head
he saidrogers was killed as he was chopping firewoodthat is to say first thing when he got up
the brent wouldnt have needed to wander about outside for hours afterwards
if you ask me the murderer of rogers would take jolly good care to be rolled up in bed snoringblore saidyoure missing the point mr lombard
if the woman was innocent shed be too dead scared to go wandering about by herself
shed only do that if she knew that she had nothing to fear
thats to say if she herself is the criminalphilip lombard saidthats a good point  yes i hadnt thought of thathe added with a faint gringlad you dont still suspect meblore said rather shamefacedlyi did start by thinking of youthat revolverand the queer story you toldor didnt tell
but ive realized now that that was really a bit too obvious he paused and said hope you feel the same about mephilip said thoughtfullyi may be wrong of course but i cant feel that youve got enough imagination for this job
all i can say is if youre the criminal youre a damned fine actor and i take my hat off to you he lowered his voice
just between ourselves blore and taking into account that well probably both be a couple of stiffs before another day is out you did indulge in that spot of perjury i supposeblore shifted uneasily from one foot to the other
he said at lastdoesnt seem to make much odds now
oh well here goes landor was innocent right enough
the gang had got me squared and between us we got him put away for a stretch
mind you i wouldnt admit thisif there were any witnesses finished lombard with a grin
its just between you and me
well i hope you made a tidy bit out of itdidnt make what i should have done
mean crowd the purcell gang
i got my promotion thoughand landor got penal servitude and died in prisoni couldnt know he was going to die could i demanded blore
no that was your bad luckmine
his you meanyours too
because as a result of it it looks as though your own life is going to be cut unpleasantly shortme blore stared at him
do you think im going to go the way of rogers and the rest of them
not me
im watching out for myself pretty carefully i can tell youlombard saidoh wellim not a betting man
and anyway if you were dead i wouldnt get paidlook here mr lombard what do you meanphilip lombard showed his teeth
he saidi mean my dear blore that in my opinion you havent got a chancewhatyour lack of imagination is going to make you absolutely a sitting target
a criminal of the imagination of u n owen can make rings round you any time heor shewants toblores face went crimson
he demanded angrilyand what about youphilip lombards face went hard and dangerous
he saidive a pretty good imagination of my own
ive been in tight places before now and got out of them
i thinki wont say more than that but i think ill get out of this onevthe eggs were in the frying pan
vera toasting bread thought to herselfwhy did i make a hysterical fool of myself
that was a mistake
keep calm my girl keep calmafter all shed always prided herself on her levelheadedness
miss claythorne was wonderfulkept her headstarted off swimming after cyril at oncewhy think of that now
all that was overover  cyril had disappeared long before she got near the rock
she had felt the current take her sweeping her out to sea
she had let herself go with itswimming quietly floatingtill the boat arrived at last
they had praised her courage and her sangfroidbut not hugo
hugo had justlooked at hergod how it hurt even now to think of hugo
where was he
what was he doing
was he engagedmarried
emily brent said sharplyvera that toast is burningoh sorry miss brent so it is
how stupid of meemily brent lifted out the last egg from the sizzling fat
vera putting a fresh piece of bread on the toasting fork said curiouslyyoure wonderfully calm miss brentemily brent said pressing her lips togetheri was brought up to keep my head and never to make a fussvera thought mechanicallyrepressed as a child  that accounts for a lotshe saidarent you afraidshe paused and then addedor dont you mind dyingdying
it was as though a sharp little gimlet had run into the solid congealed mess of emily brents brain
dying
but she wasnt going to die
the others would dieyesbut not she emily brent
this girl didnt understand
emily wasnt afraid naturallynone of the brents were afraid
all her people were service people
they faced death unflinchingly
they led upright lives just as she emily brent had led an upright life  she had never done anything to be ashamed of  and so naturally she wasnt going to die
the lord is mindful of his own thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day it was daylight nowthere was no terror
we shall none of us leave this island who had said that
general macarthur of course whose cousin had married elsie macpherson
he hadnt seemed to care
he had seemedactuallyto welcome the idea
wicked
almost impious to feel that way
some people thought so little of death that they actually took their own lives
beatrice taylor last night she had dreamed of beatricedreamt that she was outside pressing her face against the window and moaning asking to be let in
but emily brent hadnt wanted to let her in
because if she did something terrible would happen
emily came to herself with a start
that girl was looking at her very strangely
she said in a brisk voiceeverythings ready isnt it
well take the breakfast invibreakfast was a curious meal
every one was very polite
may i get you some more coffee miss brentmiss claythorne a slice of hamanother piece of toastsix people all outwardly selfpossessed and normal
and within
thoughts that ran round in a circle like squirrels in a cage
what next
what next
who
whichwould it work
i wonder
its worth trying
if theres time
my god if theres timereligious mania thats the ticket  looking at her though you can hardly believe it  suppose im wrongits crazyeverythings crazy
im going crazy
wool disappearingred silk curtainsit doesnt make sense
i cant get the hang of itthe damned fool he believed every word i said to him
it was easy  i must be careful though very carefulsix of those little china figures  only sixhow many will there be by tonight
wholl have the last eggmarmaladethanks can i cut you some breadsix people behaving normally at breakfast
twelveithe meal was over
mr justice wargrave cleared his throat
he said in a small authoritative voiceit would be advisable i think if we met to discuss the situation
shall we say in half an hours time in the drawing roomevery one made a sound suggestive of agreement
vera began to pile plates together
she saidill clear away and wash upphilip lombard saidwell bring the stuff out to the pantry for youthanksemily brent rising to her feet sat down again
she saidoh dearthe judge saidanything the matter miss brentemily said apologeticallyim sorry
id like to help miss claythorne but i dont know how it is
i feel just a little giddygiddy eh dr armstrong came towards her
quite natural
delayed shock
i can give you something tonothe word burst from her lips like an exploding shell
it took every one aback
dr armstrong flushed a deep red
there was no mistaking the fear and suspicion in her face
he said stifflyjust as you please miss brentshe saidi dont wish to take anythinganything at all
i will just sit here quietly till the giddiness passes offthey finished clearing away the breakfast things
blore saidim a domestic sort of man
ill give you a hand miss claythornevera said thank youemily brent was left alone sitting in the dining room
for a while she heard a faint murmur of voices from the pantry
the giddiness was passing
she felt drowsy now as though she could easily go to sleep
there was a buzzing in her earsor was it a real buzzing in the room
she thoughtits like a beea bumble beepresently she saw the bee
it was crawling up the windowpane
vera claythorne had talked about bees this morning
bees and honey
she liked honey
honey in the comb and strain it yourself through a muslin bag
drip drip drip
there was somebody in the room  somebody all wet and dripping beatrice taylor come from the rivershe had only to turn her head and she would see her
but she couldnt turn her head
if she were to call out
but she couldnt call out
there was no one else in the house
she was all alone
she heard footstepssoft dragging footsteps coming up behind her
the stumbling footsteps of the drowned girl
there was a wet dank smell in her nostrils
on the windowpane the bee was buzzingbuzzing
and then she felt the prick
the bee sting on the side of her neck
iiin the drawing room they were waiting for emily brent
vera claythorne saidshall i go and fetch herblore said quicklyjust a minutevera sat down again
every one looked inquiringly at blore
he saidlook here everybody my opinions this we neednt look farther for the author of these deaths than the dining room at this minute
id take my oath that womans the one were afterarmstrong saidand the motivereligious mania
what do you say doctorarmstrong saidits perfectly possible
ive nothing to say against it
but of course weve no proofvera saidshe was very odd in the kitchen when we were getting breakfast
her eyes she shivered
lombard saidyou cant judge her by that
were all a bit off our heads by nowblore saidtheres another thing
shes the only one who wouldnt give an explanation after that gramophone record
why
because she hadnt any to givevera stirred in her chair
she saidthats not quite true
she told meafterwardswargrave saidwhat did she tell you miss claythornevera repeated the story of beatrice taylor
mr justice wargrave observeda perfectly straightforward story
i personally should have no difficulty in accepting it
tell me miss claythorne did she appear to be troubled by a sense of guilt or a feeling of remorse for her attitude in the matternone whatever said vera
she was completely unmovedblore saidhearts as hard as flints these righteous spinsters
envy mostlymr justice wargrave saidit is now five minutes to eleven
i think we should summon miss brent to join our conclaveblore saidarent you going to take any actionthe judge saidi fail to see what action we can take
our suspicions are at the moment only suspicions
i will however ask dr armstrong to observe miss brents demeanour very carefully
let us now go into the dining roomthey found emily brent sitting in the chair in which they had left her
from behind they saw nothing amiss except that she did not seem to hear their entrance into the room
and then they saw her facesuffused with blood with blue lips and starting eyes
blore saidmy god shes deadiiithe small quiet voice of mr justice wargrave saidone more of us acquittedtoo latearmstrong was bent over the dead woman
he sniffed the lips shook his head peered into the eyelids
lombard said impatientlyhow did she die doctor
she was all right when we left her herearmstrongs attention was riveted on a mark on the right side of the neck
he saidthats the mark of a hypodermic syringethere was a buzzing sound from the window
vera criedlooka beea bumble bee
remember what i said this morningarmstrong said grimlyit wasnt that bee that stung her
a human hand held the syringethe judge askedwhat poison was injectedarmstrong answeredat a guess one of the cyanides
probably potassium cyanide same as anthony marston
she must have died almost immediately by asphyxiationvera criedbut that bee
it cant be coincidencelombard said grimlyoh no it isnt coincidence
its our murderers touch of local colour
hes a playful beast
likes to stick to his damnable nursery jingle as closely as possiblefor the first time his voice was uneven almost shrill
it was as though even his nerves seasoned by a long career of hazards and dangerous undertakings had given out at last
he said violentlyits madabsolutely madwere all madthe judge said calmlywe have still i hope our reasoning powers
did any one bring a hypodermic syringe to this housedr armstrong straightening himself said in a voice that was not too well assuredyes i didfour pairs of eyes fastened on him
he braced himself against the deep hostile suspicion of those eyes
he saidalways travel with one
most doctors domr justice wargrave said calmlyquite so
will you tell us doctor where that syringe is nowin the suitcase in my roomwargrave saidwe might perhaps verify that factthe five of them went upstairs a silent procession
the contents of the suitcase were turned out on the floor
the hypodermic syringe was not there
ivarmstrong said violentlysomebody must have taken itthere was silence in the room
armstrong stood with his back to the window
four pairs of eyes were on him black with suspicion and accusation
he looked from wargrave to vera and repeated helplesslyweaklyi tell you someone must have taken itblore was looking at lombard who returned his gaze
the judge saidthere are five of us here in this room
one of us is a murderer
the position is fraught with grave danger
everything must be done in order to safeguard the four of us who are innocent
i will now ask you dr armstrong what drugs you have in your possessionarmstrong repliedi have a small medicine case here
you can examine it
you will find some sleeping stufftrional and sulphonal tabletsa packet of bromide bicarbonate of soda aspirin
nothing else
i have no cyanide in my possessionthe judge saidi have myself some sleeping tabletssulphonal i think they are
i presume they would be lethal if a sufficiently large dose were given
you mr lombard have in your possession a revolverphilip lombard said sharplywhat if i haveonly this
i propose that the doctors supply of drugs my own sulphonal tablets your revolver and anything else of the nature of drugs or firearms should be collected together and placed in a safe place
that after this is done we should each of us submit to a searchboth of our persons and of our effectslombard saidim damned if ill give up my revolverwargrave said sharplymr
lombard you are a very strongly built and powerful young man but exinspector blore is also a man of powerful physique
i do not know what the outcome of a struggle between you would be but i can tell you this
on blores side assisting him to the best of our ability will be myself dr armstrong and miss claythorne
you will appreciate therefore that the odds against you if you choose to resist will be somewhat heavylombard threw his head back
his teeth showed in what was almost a snarl
oh very well then
since youve got it all taped outmr justice wargrave nodded his head
you are a sensible young man
where is this revolver of yoursin the drawer of the table by my bedgoodill fetch iti think it would be desirable if we went with youphilip said with a smile that was still nearer a snarlsuspicious devil arent youthey went along the corridor to lombards room
philip strode across to the bed table and jerked open the drawer
then he recoiled with an oath
the drawer of the bed table was empty
vsatisfied asked lombard
he had stripped to the skin and he and his room had been meticulously searched by the other three men
vera claythorne was outside in the corridor
the search proceeded methodically
in turn armstrong the judge and blore submitted to the same test
the four men emerged from blores room and approached vera
it was the judge who spoke
i hope you will understand miss claythorne that we can make no exceptions
that revolver must be found
you have i presume a bathing dress with youvera nodded
then i will ask you to go into your room and put it on and then come out to us herevera went into her room and shut the door
she reappeared in under a minute dressed in a tightfitting silk rucked bathing dress
wargrave nodded approval
thank you miss claythorne
now if you will remain here we will search your roomvera waited patiently in the corridor until they emerged
then she went in dressed and came out to where they were waiting
the judge saidwe are now assured of one thing
there are no lethal weapons or drugs in the possession of any of us five
that is one point to the good
we will now place the drugs in a safe place
there is i think a silver chest is there not in the pantryblore saidthats all very well but whos to have the key
you i supposemr justice wargrave made no reply
he went down to the pantry and the others followed him
there was a small case there designed for the purpose of holding silver and plate
by the judges directions the various drugs were placed in this and it was locked
then still on wargraves instructions the chest was lifted into the plate cupboard and this in turn was locked
the judge then gave the key of the chest to philip lombard and the key of the cupboard to blore
he saidyou two are the strongest physically
it would be difficult for either of you to get the key from the other
it would be impossible for any of us three to do so
to break open the cupboardor the plate chestwould be a noisy and cumbersome proceeding and one which could hardly be carried out without attention being attracted to what was going onhe paused then went onwe are still faced by one very grave problem
what has become of mr lombards revolverblore saidseems to me its owner is the most likely person to know thata white dint showed in philip lombards nostrils
he saidyou damned pigheaded fool
i tell you its been stolen from mewargrave askedwhen did you see it lastlast night
it was in the drawer when i went to bedready in case anything happenedthe judge nodded
he saidit must have been taken this morning during the confusion of searching for rogers or after his dead body was discoveredvera saidit must be hidden somewhere about the house
we must look for itmr justice wargraves finger was stroking his chin
he saidi doubt if our search will result in anything
our murderer has had plenty of time to devise a hiding place
i do not fancy we shall find that revolver easilyblore said forcefullyi dont know where the revolver is but ill bet i know where something else isthat hypodermic syringe
follow mehe opened the front door and led the way round the house
a little distance away from the dining room window he found the syringe
beside it was a smashed china figurea sixth broken soldier boy
blore said in a satisfied voiceonly place it could be
after hed killed her he opened the window and threw out the syringe and picked up the china figure from the table and followed on with thatthere were no prints on the syringe
it had been carefully wiped
vera said in a determined voicenow let us look for the revolvermr justice wargrave saidby all means
but in doing so let us be careful to keep together
remember if we separate the murderer gets his chancethey searched the house carefully from attic to cellars but without result
the revolver was still missing
thirteenione of us  one of us  one of usthree words endlessly repeated dinning themselves hour after hour into receptive brains
five peoplefive frightened people
five people who watched each other who now hardly troubled to hide their state of nervous tension
there was little pretence nowno formal veneer of conversation
they were five enemies linked together by a mutual instinct of selfpreservation
and all of them suddenly looked less like human beings
they were reverting to more bestial types
like a wary old tortoise mr justice wargrave sat hunched up his body motionless his eyes keen and alert
exinspector blore looked coarser and clumsier in build
his walk was that of a slow padding animal
his eyes were bloodshot
there was a look of mingled ferocity and stupidity about him
he was like a beast at bay ready to charge its pursuers
philip lombards senses seemed heightened rather than diminished
his ears reacted to the slightest sound
his step was lighter and quicker his body was lithe and graceful
and he smiled often his lips curling back from his long white teeth
vera claythorne was very quiet
she sat most of the time huddled in a chair
her eyes stared ahead of her into space
she looked dazed
she was like a bird that has dashed its head against glass and that has been picked up by a human hand
it crouches there terrified unable to move hoping to save itself by its immobility
armstrong was in a pitiable condition of nerves
he twitched and his hands shook
he lighted cigarette after cigarette and stubbed them out almost immediately
the forced inaction of their position seemed to gall him more than the others
every now and then he broke out into a torrent of nervous speech
wewe shouldnt just sit here doing nothing
there must be somethingsurely surely there is something that we can do
if we lit a bonfireblore said heavilyin this weatherthe rain was pouring down again
the wind came in fitful gusts
the depressing sound of the pattering rain nearly drove them mad
by tacit consent they had adopted a plan of campaign
they all sat in the big drawing room
only one person left the room at a time
the other four waited till the fifth returned
lombard saidits only a question of time
the weather will clear
then we can do somethingsignallight firesmake a raftsomethingarmstrong said with a sudden cackle of laughtera question of timetime
we cant afford time
we shall all be deadmr justice wargrave said and his small clear voice was heavy with passionate determinationnot if we are careful
we must be very carefulthe midday meal had been duly eatenbut there had been no conventional formality about it
all five of them had gone to the kitchen
in the larder they had found a great store of tinned foods
they had opened a tin of tongue and two tins of fruit
they had eaten standing round the kitchen table
then herding close together they had returned to the drawing roomto sit theresit watching each other
and by now the thoughts that ran through their brains were abnormal feverish diseased
its armstrong  i saw him looking at me sideways just then  his eyes are mad  quite mad  perhaps he isnt a doctor at all  thats it of course hes a lunatic escaped from some doctors housepretending to be a doctor  its true  shall i tell them
 shall i scream out
 no it wont do to put him on his guard  besides he can seem so sane  what time is it
 only a quarter past three oh god i shall go mad myself yes its armstrong hes watching me nowthey wont get me
i can take care of myself  ive been in tight places before  where the hell is that revolver who took it
 whos got it
 nobodys got itwe know that
we were all searched  nobody can have it but someone knows where it istheyre going mad  theyll all go mad  afraid of death  were all afraid of death im afraid of death  yes but that doesnt stop death coming âthe hearse is at the door sir where did i read that
the girl  ill watch the girl
yes ill watch the girltwenty to four  only twenty to four  perhaps the clock has stopped  i dont understandno i dont understand  this sort of thing cant happen it is happening why dont we wake up

if only i could think  my headsomethings happening in my headits going to burstits going to split  this sort of thing cant happen  whats the time
oh god its only a quarter to fouri must keep my head  i must keep my head  if only i keep my head  its all perfectly clearall worked out
but nobody must suspect
it may do the trick
it must
which one
thats the questionwhich one
i thinkyes i rather thinkyeshimwhen the clock struck five they all jumped
vera saiddoes anyonewant teathere was a moments silence
blore saidid like a cupvera rose
she saidill go and make it
you can all stay heremr justice wargrave said gentlyi think my dear young lady we would all prefer to come and watch you make itvera stared then gave a short rather hysterical laugh
she saidof course
you wouldfive people went into the kitchen
tea was made and drunk by vera and blore
the other three had whiskyopening a fresh bottle and using a siphon from a nailed up case
the judge murmured with a reptilian smilewe must be very carefulthey went back again to the drawing room
although it was summer the room was dark
lombard switched on the lights but they did not come on
he saidof course
the engines not been run today since rogers hasnt been there to see to ithe hesitated and saidwe could go out and get it going i supposemr justice wargrave saidthere are packets of candles in the larder i saw them better use thoselombard went out
the other four sat watching each other
he came back with a box of candles and a pile of saucers
five candles were lit and placed about the room
the time was a quarter to six
iiat twenty past six vera felt that to sit there longer was unbearable
she would go to her room and bathe her aching head and temples in cold water
she got up and went towards the door
then she remembered and came back and got a candle out of the box
she lighted it let a little wax pour into a saucer and stuck the candle firmly to it
then she went out of the room shutting the door behind her and leaving the four men inside
she went up the stairs and along the passage to her room
as she opened her door she suddenly halted and stood stock still
her nostrils quivered
the sea  the smell of the sea at st tredennick
that was it
she could not be mistaken
of course one smelt the sea on an island anyway but this was different
it was the smell there had been on the beach that daywith the tide out and the rocks covered with seaweed drying in the sun
can i swim out to the island miss claythornewhy cant i swim out to the island
horrid whiney spoilt little brat
if it werent for him hugo would be rich  able to marry the girl he loved
hugosurelysurelyhugo was beside her
no waiting for her in the roomshe made a step forward
the draught from the window caught the flame of the candle
it flickered and went out
in the dark she was suddenly afraid
dont be a fool vera claythorne urged herself
its all right
the others are downstairs
all four of them
theres no one in the room
there cant be
youre imagining things my girlbut that smellthat smell of the beach at st tredennick  that wasnt imagined
it was true
and there was someone in the room  she had heard somethingsurely she had heard something
and then as she stood there listeninga cold clammy hand touched her throata wet hand smelling of the sea
iiivera screamed
she screamed and screamedscreams of the utmost terrorwild desperate cries for help
she did not hear the sounds from below of a chair being overturned of a door opening of mens feet running up the stairs
she was conscious only of supreme terror
then restoring her sanity lights flickered in the doorwaycandlesmen hurrying into the room
what the devil whats happened good god what is itshe shuddered took a step forward collapsed on the floor
she was only half aware of someone bending over her of someone forcing her head down between her knees
then at a sudden exclamation a quick my god look at that her senses returned
she opened her eyes and raised her head
she saw what it was the men with the candles were looking at
a broad ribbon of wet seaweed was hanging down from the ceiling
it was that which in the darkness had swayed against her throat
it was that which she had taken for a clammy hand a drowned hand come back from the dead to squeeze the life out of her
she began to laugh hysterically
she saidit was seaweedonly seaweedand thats what the smell wasand then the faintness came over her once morewaves upon waves of sickness
again someone took her head and forced it between her knees
aeons of time seemed to pass
they were offering her something to drinkpressing the glass against her lips
she smelt brandy
she was just about to gulp the spirit gratefully down when suddenly a warning notelike an alarm bellsounded in her brain
she sat up pushing the glass away
she said sharply where did this come fromblores voice answered
he stared a minute before speaking
he saidi got it from downstairsvera criedi wont drink itthere was a moments silence then lombard laughed
he said with appreciationgood for you vera
youve got your wits about youeven if you have been scared half out of your life
ill get a fresh bottle that hasnt been openedhe went swiftly out
vera said uncertainlyim all right now
ill have some waterarmstrong supported her as she struggled to her feet
she went over to the basin swaying and clutching at him for support
she let the cold tap run and then filled the glass
blore said resentfullythat brandys all rightarmstrong saidhow do you knowblore said angrilyi didnt put anything in it
thats what youre getting at i supposearmstrong saidim not saying you did
you might have done or someone might have tampered with the bottle for just this emergencylombard came swiftly back into the room
he had a new bottle of brandy in his hands and a corkscrew
he thrust the sealed bottle under veras nose
there you are my girl
absolutely no deception he peeled off the tin foil and drew the cork
lucky theres a good supply of spirits in the house
thoughtful of u n owenvera shuddered violently
armstrong held the glass while philip poured the brandy into it
he saidyoud better drink this miss claythorne
youve had a nasty shockvera drank a little of the spirit
the colour came back to her face
philip lombard said with a laughwell heres one murder that hasnt gone according to planvera said almost in a whisperyou thinkthat was what was meantlombard nodded
expected you to pass out through fright
some people would have wouldnt they doctorarmstrong did not commit himself
he said doubtfullyhm impossible to say
young healthy subjectno cardiac weakness
unlikely
on the other handhe picked up the glass of brandy that blore had brought
he dipped a finger in it tasted it gingerly
his expression did not alter
he said dubiously hm tastes all rightblore stepped forward angrily
he saidif youre saying that i tampered with that ill knock your ruddy block offvera her wits revived by the brandy made a diversion by sayingwheres the judgethe three men looked at each other
thats odd thought he came up with usblore saidso did i what about it doctor you came up the stairs behind mearmstrong saidi thought he was following me  of course hed be bound to go slower than we did
hes an old manthey looked at each other again
lombard saidits damned oddblore criedwe must look for himhe started for the door
the others followed him vera last
as they went down the stairs armstrong said over his shoulderof course he may have stayed in the living roomthey crossed the hall
armstrong called out loudlywargrave wargrave where are youthere was no answer
a deadly silence filled the house apart from the gentle patter of the rain
then in the entrance to the drawing room door armstrong stopped dead
the others crowded up and looked over his shoulder
somebody cried out
mr justice wargrave was sitting in his highbacked chair at the end of the room
two candles burnt on either side of him
but what shocked and startled the onlookers was the fact that he sat there robed in scarlet with a judges wig upon his head
dr armstrong motioned to the others to keep back
he himself walked across to the silent staring figure reeling a little as he walked like a drunken man
he bent forward peering into the still face
then with a swift movement he raised the wig
it fell to the floor revealing the high bald forehead with in the very middle a round stained mark from which something had trickled
dr armstrong lifted the lifeless hand and felt for the pulse
then he turned to the others
he saidand his voice was expressionless dead far away
hes been shotblore saidgodthe revolverthe doctor said still in the same lifeless voicegot him through the head
instantaneousvera stooped to the wig
she said and her voice shook with horrormiss brents missing grey woolblore saidand the scarlet curtain that was missing from the bathroomvera whisperedso this is what they wanted them forsuddenly philip lombard laugheda high unnatural laugh
five little soldier boys going in for law one got in chancery and then there were four
thats the end of mr bloody justice wargrave
no more pronouncing sentence for him
no more putting on of the black cap
heres the last time hell ever sit in court
no more summing up and sending innocent men to death
how edward seton would laugh if he were here
god how hed laughhis outburst shocked and startled the others
vera criedonly this morning you said he was the onephilip lombards face changedsobered
he said in a low voicei know i did  well i was wrong
heres one more of us whos been proved innocenttoo latefourteenithey had carried mr justice wargrave up to his room and laid him on the bed
then they had come down again and had stood in the hall looking at each other
blore said heavilywhat do we do nowlombard said brisklyhave something to eat
weve got to eat you knowonce again they went into the kitchen
again they opened a tin of tongue
they ate mechanically almost without tasting
vera saidi shall never eat tongue againthey finished the meal
they sat round the kitchen table staring at each other
blore saidonly four of us now wholl be the nextarmstrong stared
he said almost mechanicallywe must be very careful and stopped
blore nodded
thats what he said  and now hes deadarmstrong saidhow did it happen i wonderlombard swore
he saida damned clever doublecross
that stuff was planted in miss claythornes room and it worked just as it was intended to
everyone dashes up there thinking shes being murdered
and soin the confusionsomeonecaught the old boy off his guardblore saidwhy didnt anyone hear the shotlombard shook his head
miss claythorne was screaming the wind was howling we were running about and calling out
no it wouldnt be heard he paused
but that tricks not going to work again
hell have to try something else nextblore saidhe probably willthere was an unpleasant tone in his voice
the two men eyed each other
armstrong saidfour of us and we dont know whichblore saidi knowvera saidi havent the least doubtarmstrong said slowlyi suppose i do know reallyphilip lombard saidi think ive got a pretty good idea nowagain they all looked at each other
vera staggered to her feet
she saidi feel awful
i must go to bed  im dead beatlombard saidmight as well
no good sitting watching each otherblore saidive no objectionthe doctor murmuredthe best thing to doalthough i doubt if any of us will sleepthey moved to the door
blore saidi wonder where that revolver is nowiithey went up the stairs
the next move was a little like a scene in a farce
each one of the four stood with a hand on his or her bedroom door handle
then as though at a signal each one stepped into the room and pulled the door shut
there were sounds of bolts and locks of the moving of furniture
four frightened people were barricaded in until morning
iiiphilip lombard drew a breath of relief as he turned from adjusting a chair under the door handle
he strolled across to the dressing table
by the light of the flickering candle he studied his face curiously
he said softly to himselfyes this business has got you rattled all righthis sudden wolflike smile flashed out
he undressed quickly
he went over to the bed placing his wristwatch on the table by the bed
then he opened the drawer of the table
he stood there staring down at the revolver that was inside it
ivvera claythorne lay in bed
the candle still burned beside her
and yet she could not summon the courage to put it out
she was afraid of the dark
she told herself again and again youre all right until morning
nothing happened last night
nothing will happen tonight
nothing can happen
youre locked and bolted in
no one can come near youand she thought suddenlyof course
i can stay here
stay here locked in
food doesnt really matter
i can stay heresafelytill help comes
even if its a dayor two daysstay here
yes but could she stay here
hour after hourwith no one to speak to with nothing to do but thinkshed begin to think of cornwallof hugoofof what shed said to cyril
horrid whiney little boy always pestering her
miss claythorne why cant i swim out to the rock
i can
i know i canwas it her voice that had answered
of course you can cyril really
i know thatcan i go then miss claythornewell you see cyril your mother gets so nervous about you
ill tell you what
tomorrow you can swim out to the rock
ill talk to your mother on the beach and distract her attention
and then when she looks for you there youll be standing on the rock waving to her
it will be a surpriseoh good egg miss claythorne
that will be a larkshed said it now
tomorrow
hugo was going to newquay
when he came backit would be all over
yes but supposing it wasnt
supposing it went wrong
cyril might be rescued in time
and thenthen hed say miss claythorne said i could well what of it
one must take some risk
if the worst happened shed brazen it out
how can you tell such a wicked lie cyril
of course i never said any such thing theyd believe her all right
cyril often told stories
he was an untruthful child
cyril would know of course
but that didnt matter  and anyway nothing would go wrong
shed pretend to swim out after him
but shed arrive too late  nobody would ever suspect
had hugo suspected
was that why he had looked at her in that queer faroff way had hugo known
was that why he had gone off after the inquest so hurriedly
he hadnt answered the one letter she had written to him
hugovera turned restlessly in bed
no no she mustnt think of hugo
it hurt too much
that was all over over and done with  hugo must be forgotten
why this evening had she suddenly felt that hugo was in the room with her
she stared up at the ceiling stared at the big black hook in the middle of the room
shed never noticed that hook before
the seaweed had hung from that
she shivered as she remembered that cold clammy touch on her neck
she didnt like that hook on the ceiling
it drew your eyes fascinated you  a big black hook
vexinspector blore sat on the side of his bed
his small eyes redrimmed and bloodshot were alert in the solid mass of his face
he was like a wild boar waiting to charge
he felt no inclination to sleep
the menace was coming very near now  six out of ten
for all his sagacity for all his caution and astuteness the old judge had gone the way of the rest
blore snorted with a kind of savage satisfaction
what was it the old geezer had said
we must be very carefulselfrighteous smug old hypocrite
sitting up in court feeling like god almighty
hed got his all right  no more being careful for him
and now there were four of them
the girl lombard armstrong and himself
very soon another of them would go  but it wouldnt be william henry blore
hed see to that all right
but the revolver  what about the revolver
that was the disturbing factorthe revolver
blore sat on his bed his brow furrowed his little eyes creased and puckered while he pondered the problem of the revolver
in the silence he could hear the clocks strike downstairs
midnight
he relaxed a little noweven went so far as to lie down on his bed
but he did not undress
he lay there thinking
going over the whole business from the beginning methodically painstakingly as he had been wont to do in his police officer days
it was thoroughness that paid in the end
the candle was burning down
looking to see if the matches were within easy reach of his hand he blew it out
strangely enough he found the darkness disquieting
it was as though a thousand ageold fears woke and struggled for supremacy in his brain
faces floated in the airthe judges face crowned with that mockery of grey woolthe cold dead face of mrs rogersthe convulsed purple face of anthony marston
another facepale spectacled with a small strawcoloured moustache
a face that he had seen sometime or otherbut when
not on the island
no much longer ago than that
funny that he couldnt put a name to it  silly sort of face reallyfellow looked a bit of a mug
of course
it came to him with a real shock
landor
odd to think hed completely forgotten what landor looked like
only yesterday hed been trying to recall the fellows face and hadnt been able to
and now here it was every feature clear and distinct as though he had seen it only yesterday
landor had had a wifea thin slip of a woman with a worried face
thered been a kid too a girl about fourteen
for the first time he wondered what had become of them
the revolver
what had become of the revolver
that was much more important
the more he thought about it the more puzzled he was  he didnt understand this revolver business
somebody in the house had got that revolver
downstairs a clock struck one
blores thoughts were cut short
he sat up on the bed suddenly alert
for he had heard a sounda very faint soundsomewhere outside his bedroom door
there was someone moving about in the darkened house
the perspiration broke out on his forehead
who was it moving secretly and silently along the corridors
someone who was up to no good hed bet that
noiselessly in spite of his heavy build he dropped off the bed and with two strides was standing by the door listening
but the sound did not come again
nevertheless blore was convinced that he was not mistaken
he had heard a footfall just outside his door
the hair rose slightly on his scalp
he knew fear again
someone creeping about stealthily in the night
he listenedbut the sound was not repeated
and now a new temptation assailed him
he wanted desperately to go out and investigate
if he could only see who it was prowling about in the darkness
but to open his door would be the action of a fool
very likely that was exactly what the other was waiting for
he might even have meant blore to hear what he had heard counting on him coming out to investigate
blore stood rigidlistening
he could hear sounds everywhere now cracks rustles mysterious whispersbut his dogged realistic brain knew them for what they werethe creations of his own heated imagination
and then suddenly he heard something that was not imagination
footsteps very soft very cautious but plainly audible to a man listening with all his ears as blore was listening
they came softly along the corridor both lombards and armstrongs rooms were farther from the stairhead than his
they passed his door without hesitating or faltering
and as they did so blore made up his mind
he meant to see who it was
the footsteps had definitely passed his door going to the stairs
where was the man going
when blore acted he acted quickly surprisingly so for a man who looked so heavy and slow
he tiptoed back to the bed slipped matches into his pocket detached the plug of the electric lamp by his bed and picked it up winding the flex round it
it was a chromium affair with a heavy ebonite basea useful weapon
he sprinted noiselessly across the room removed the chair from under the door handle and with precaution unlocked and unbolted the door
he stepped out into the corridor
there was a faint sound in the hall below
blore ran noiselessly in his stockinged feet to the head of the stairs
at that moment he realized why it was he had heard all these sounds so clearly
the wind had died down completely and the sky must have cleared
there was faint moonlight coming in through the landing window and it illuminated the hall below
blore had an instantaneous glimpse of a figure just passing out through the front door
in the act of running down the stairs in pursuit he paused
once again he had nearly made a fool of himself
this was a trap perhaps to lure him out of the house
but what the other man didnt realize was that he had made a mistake had delivered himself neatly into blores hands
for of the three tenanted rooms upstairs one must now be empty
all that had to be done was to ascertain which
blore went swiftly back along the corridor
he paused first at dr armstrongs door and tapped
there was no answer
he waited a minute then went on to philip lombards room
here the answer came at once
whos thereits blore
i dont think armstrong is in his room
wait a minutehe went on to the door at the end of the corridor
here he tapped again
miss claythorne
miss claythorneveras voice startled answered him
who is it
whats the matterits all right miss claythorne
wait a minute
ill come backhe raced back to lombards room
the door opened as he did so
lombard stood there
he held a candle in his left hand
he had pulled on his trousers over his pyjamas
his right hand rested in the pocket of his pyjama jacket
he said sharplywhat the hells all thisblore explained rapidly
lombards eyes lit up
armstrongeh
so hes our pigeon he moved along to armstrongs door
sorry blore but i dont take anything on trusthe rapped sharply on the panel
armstrongarmstrongthere was no answer
lombard dropped to his knees and peered through the keyhole
he inserted his little finger gingerly into the lock
he saidkeys not in the door on the insideblore saidthat means he locked it on the outside and took it with himphilip nodded
ordinary precaution to take
well get him blore this time well get him
half a secondhe raced along to veras room
verayeswere hunting armstrong
hes out of his room
whatever you do dont open your door
understandyes i understandif armstrong comes along and says that ive been killed or blores been killed pay no attention
see
only open your door if both blore and i speak to you
got thatvera saidyes
im not a complete foollombard saidgoodhe joined blore
he saidand nowafter him
the hunts upblore saidwed better be careful
hes got a revolver rememberphilip lombard racing down the stairs chuckled
he saidthats where youre wrong he undid the front door remarking latch pushed backso he could get in again easilyhe went onive got that revolver he took it half out of his pocket as he spoke
found it put back in my drawer tonightblore stopped dead on the doorstep
his face changed
philip lombard saw it
dont be a damned fool blore
im not going to shoot you
go back and barricade yourself in if you like
im off after armstronghe started off into the moonlight
blore after a minutes hesitation followed him
he thought to himselfi suppose im asking for it
after allafter all he had tackled criminals armed with revolvers before now
whatever else he lacked blore did not lack courage
show him the danger and he would tackle it pluckily
he was not afraid of danger in the open only of danger undefined and tinged with the supernatural
vivera left to await results got up and dressed
she glanced over once or twice at the door
it was a good solid door
it was both bolted and locked and had an oak chair wedged under the handle
it could not be broken open by force
certainly not by dr armstrong
he was not a physically powerful man
if she were armstrong intent on murder it was cunning that she would employ not force
she amused herself by reflecting on the means he might employ
he might as philip had suggested announce that one of the other two men was dead
or he might possibly pretend to be mortally wounded himself might drag himself groaning to her door
there were other possibilities
he might inform her that the house was on fire
more he might actually set the house on fire  yes that would be a possibility
lure the other two men out of the house then having previously laid a trail of petrol he might set light to it
and she like an idiot would remain barricaded in her room until it was too late
she crossed over to the window
not too bad
at a pinch one could escape that way
it would mean a dropbut there was a handy flower bed
she sat down and picking up her diary began to write in it in a clear flowing hand
one must pass the time
suddenly she stiffened to attention
she had heard a sound
it was she thought a sound like breaking glass
and it came from somewhere downstairs
she listened hard but the sound was not repeated
she heard or thought she heard stealthy sounds of footsteps the creak of stairs the rustle of garmentsbut there was nothing definite and she concluded as blore had done earlier that such sounds had their origin in her own imagination
but presently she heard sounds of a more concrete nature
people moving about downstairsthe murmur of voices
then the very decided sound of someone mounting the stairsdoors opening and shuttingfeet going up to the attics overhead
more noises from there
finally the steps came along the passage
lombards voice saidvera
you all rightyes
what happenedblores voice saidwill you let us invera went to the door
she removed the chair unlocked the door and slid back the bolt
she opened the door
the two men were breathing hard their feet and the bottom of their trousers were soaking wet
she said againwhats happenedlombard saidarmstrongs disappearedviivera criedwhatlombard saidvanished clean off the islandblore concurredvanishedthats the word
like some damned conjuring trickvera said impatientlynonsense
hes hiding somewhereblore saidno he isnt
i tell you theres nowhere to hide on this island
its as bare as your hand
theres moonlight outside
as clear as day it is
and hes not to be foundvera saidhe doubled back to the houseblore saidwe thought of that
weve searched the house too
you must have heard us
hes not here i tell you
hes goneclean vanished vamoosedvera said incredulouslyi dont believe itlombard saidits true my dearhe paused and then saidtheres one other little fact
a pane in the dining room window has been smashedand there are only three little soldier boys on the tablefifteenithree people sat eating breakfast in the kitchen
outside the sun shone
it was a lovely day
the storm was a thing of the past
and with the change in the weather a change had come in the mood of the prisoners on the island
they felt now like people just awakening from a nightmare
there was danger yes but it was danger in daylight
that paralysing atmosphere of fear that had wrapped them round like a blanket yesterday while the wind howled outside was gone
lombard saidwell try heliographing today with a mirror from the highest point of the island
some bright lad wandering on the cliff will recognize sos when he sees it i hope
in the evening we could try a bonfireonly there isnt much woodand anyway they might just think it was song and dance and merrimentvera saidsurely someone can read morse
and then theyll come to take us off
long before this eveninglombard saidthe weathers cleared all right but the sea hasnt gone down yet
terrific swell on
they wont be able to get a boat near the island before tomorrowvera criedanother night in this placelombard shrugged his shoulders
may as well face it
twentyfour hours will do it i think
if we can last out that well be all rightblore cleared his throat
he saidwed better come to a clear understanding
whats happened to armstronglombard saidwell weve got one piece of evidence
only three little soldier boys left on the dinner table
it looks as though armstrong had got his quietusvera saidthen why havent you found his dead bodyblore saidexactlylombard shook his head
he saidits damned oddno getting over itblore said doubtfullyit might have been thrown into the sealombard said sharplyby whom
you
me
you saw him go out of the front door
you come along and find me in my room
we go out and search together
when the devil had i time to kill him and carry his body round the islandblore saidi dont know
but i do know one thinglombard saidwhats thatblore saidthe revolver
it was your revolver
its in your possession now
theres nothing to show that it hasnt been in your possession all alongcome now blore we were all searchedyes youd hidden it away before that happened
afterwards you just took it back againmy good blockhead i swear to you that it was put back in my drawer
greatest surprise i ever had in my life when i found it thereblore saidyou ask us to believe a thing like that
why the devil should armstrong or anyone else for that matter put it backlombard raised his shoulders hopelessly
i havent the least idea
its just crazy
the last thing one would expect
there seems no point in itblore agreed
no there isnt
you might have thought of a better storyrather proof that im telling the truth isnt iti dont look at it that wayphilip saidyou wouldntblore saidlook here mr lombard if youre an honest man as you pretendphilip murmuredwhen did i lay claims to being an honest man
no indeed i never said thatblore went on stolidlyif youre speaking the truththeres only one thing to be done
as long as you have that revolver miss claythorne and i are at your mercy
the only fair thing is to put that revolver with the other things that are locked upand you and i will hold the two keys stillphilip lombard lit a cigarette
as he puffed smoke he saiddont be an assyou wont agree to thatno i wont
that revolvers mine
i need it to defend myselfand im going to keep itblore saidin that case were bound to come to one conclusionthat im un owen
think what you damned well please
but ill ask you if thats so why i didnt pot you with the revolver last night
i could have about twenty times overblore shook his head
he saidi dont knowand thats a fact
you must have had some reasonvera had taken no part in the discussion
she stirred now and saidi think youre both behaving like a pair of idiotslombard looked at her
whats thisvera saidyouve forgotten the nursery rhyme
dont you see theres a clue thereshe recited in a meaning voicefour little soldier boys going out to seaa red herring swallowed one and then there were threeshe went ona red herringthats the vital clue
armstrongs not dead he took away the china soldier to make you think he was
you may say what you likearmstrongs on the island still
his disappearance is just a red herring across the tracklombard sat down again
he saidyou know you may be rightblore saidyes but if so where is he
weve searched the place
outside and insidevera said scornfullywe all searched for the revolver didnt we and couldnt find it
but it was somewhere all the timelombard murmuredtheres a slight difference in size my dear between a man and a revolververa saidi dont careim sure im rightblore murmuredrather giving himself away wasnt it
actually mentioning a red herring in the verse
he could have written it up a bit differentvera criedbut dont you see hes mad
its all mad
the whole thing of going by the rhyme is mad
dressing up the judge killing rogers when he was chopping sticksdrugging mrs rogers so that she overslept herselfarranging for a bumble bee when miss brent died
its like some horrible child playing a game
its all got to fit inblore saidyes youre right he thought a minute
at any rate theres no zoo on the island
hell have a bit of trouble getting over thatvera crieddont you see
were the zoo last night we were hardly human anymore
were the zooiithey spent the morning on the cliffs taking it in turns to flash a mirror at the mainland
there were no signs that any one saw them
no answering signals
the day was fine with a slight haze
below the sea heaved in a gigantic swell
there were no boats out
they had made another abortive search of the island
there was no trace of the missing physician
vera looked up at the house from where they were standing
she said her breath coming with a slight catch in itone feels safer here out in the open  dont lets go back into the house againlombard saidnot a bad idea
were pretty safe here no one can get at us without our seeing him a long time beforehandvera saidwell stay hereblore saidhave to pass the night somewhere
well have to go back to the house thenvera shuddered
i cant bear it
i cant go through another nightphilip saidyoull be safe enoughlocked in your roomvera murmured i suppose soshe stretched out her hands murmuringits lovelyto feel the sun againshe thoughthow odd  im almost happy
and yet i suppose im actually in danger  somehownownothing seems to matter  not in daylight  i feel full of poweri feel that i cant dieblore was looking at his wristwatch
he saidits two oclock
what about lunchvera said obstinatelyim not going back to the house
im going to stay herein the openoh come now miss claythorne
got to keep your strength up you knowvera saidif i even see a tinned tongue i shall be sick
i dont want any food
people go days on end with nothing sometimes when theyre on a dietblore saidwell i need my meals regular
what about you mr lombardphilip saidyou know i dont relish the idea of tinned tongue particularly
ill stay here with miss claythorneblore hesitated
vera saidi shall be quite all right
i dont think hell shoot me as soon as your back is turned if thats what youre afraid ofblore saidits all right if you say so
but we agreed we ought not to separatephilip saidyoure the one who wants to go into the lions den
ill come with you if you likeno you wont said blore
youll stay herephilip laughed
so youre still afraid of me
why i could shoot you both this very minute if i likedblore saidyes but that wouldnt be according to plan
its one at a time and its got to be done in a certain waywell said philip you seem to know all about itof course said blore its a bit jumpy going up to the house alonephilip said softlyand therefore will i lend you my revolver
answer no i will not
not quite so simple as that thank youblore shrugged his shoulders and began to make his way up the steep slope to the house
lombard said softlyfeeding time at the zoo
the animals are very regular in their habitsvera said anxiouslyisnt it very risky what hes doingin the sense you meanno i dont think it is
armstrongs not armed you know and anyway blore is twice a match for him in physique and hes very much on his guard
and anyway its a sheer impossibility that armstrong can be in the house
i know hes not therebutwhat other solution is therephilip said softlytheres bloreohdo you really thinklisten my girl
you heard blores story
youve got to admit that if its true i cant possibly have had anything to do with armstrongs disappearance
his story clears me
but it doesnt clear him
weve only his word for it that he heard footsteps and saw a man going downstairs and out at the front door
the whole thing may be a lie
he may have got rid of armstrong a couple of hours before thathowlombard shrugged his shoulders
that we dont know
but if you ask me weve only one danger to fearand that danger is blore
what do we know about the man
less than nothing
all this expoliceman story may be bunkum
he may be anybodya mad millionairea crazy businessmanan escaped inmate of broadmoor
one things certain
he could have done every one of these crimesvera had gone rather white
she said in a slightly breathless voiceand supposing he getsuslombard said softly patting the revolver in his pocketim going to take very good care he doesntthen he looked at her curiously
touching faith in me havent you vera
quite sure i wouldnt shoot youvera saidone has got to trust someone  as a matter of fact i think youre wrong about blore
i still think its armstrongshe turned to him suddenlydont you feelall the timethat theres someone
someone watching and waitinglombard said slowlythats just nervesvera said eagerlythen you have felt itshe shivered
she bent a little closer
tell meyou dont think she broke off went on i read a story onceabout two judges that came to a small american townfrom the supreme court
they administered justiceabsolute justice
becausethey didnt come from this world at alllombard raised his eyebrows
he saidheavenly visitants eh
no i dont believe in the supernatural
this business is human enoughvera said in a low voicesometimesim not surelombard looked at her
he saidthats conscience  after a moments silence he said very quietly so you did drown that kid after allvera said vehementlyi didnt
i didnt
youve no right to say thathe laughed easily
oh yes you did my good girl
i dont know why
cant imagine
there was a man in it probably
was that ita sudden feeling of lassitude of intense weariness spread over veras limbs
she said in a dull voiceyesthere was a man in itlombard said softlythanks
thats what i wanted to knowvera sat up suddenly
she exclaimedwhat was that
it wasnt an earthquakelombard saidno no
queer thougha thud shook the ground
and i thoughtdid you hear a sort of cry
i didthey stared up at the house
lombard saidit came from there
wed better go up and seeno no im not goingplease yourself
i amvera said desperatelyall right
ill come with youthey walked up the slope to the house
the terrace was peaceful and innocuouslooking in the sunshine
they hesitated there a minute then instead of entering by the front door they made a cautious circuit of the house
they found blore
he was spreadeagled on the stone terrace on the east side his head crushed and mangled by a great block of white marble
philip looked up
he saidwhose is that window just abovevera said in a low shuddering voiceits mineand thats the clock from my mantelpiece i remember now
it wasshaped like a bearshe repeated and her voice shook and quaveredit was shaped like a beariiiphilip grasped her shoulder
he said and his voice was urgent and grimthis settles it
armstrong is in hiding somewhere in that house
im going to get himbut vera clung to him
she crieddont be a fool
its us now
were next
he wants us to look for him
hes counting on itphilip stopped
he said thoughtfullytheres something in thatvera criedat any rate you do admit now i was righthe nodded
yesyou win
its armstrong all right
but where the devil did he hide himself
we went over the place with a finetooth combvera said urgentlyif you didnt find him last night you wont find him now thats common senselombard said reluctantlyyes buthe must have prepared a secret place beforehandnaturallyof course its just what he would do
you know like a priests hole in old manor housesthis isnt an old house of that kindhe could have had one madephilip lombard shook his head
he saidwe measured the placethat first morning
ill swear theres no space unaccounted forvera saidthere must belombard saidid like to seevera criedyes youd like to see
and he knows that
hes in therewaiting for youlombard said half bringing out the revolver from his pocketive got this you knowyou said blore was all rightthat he was more than a match for armstrong
so he was physically and he was on the look out too
but what you dont seem to realize is that armstrong is mad
and a madman has all the advantages on his side
hes twice as cunning as any one sane can belombard put back the revolver in his pocket
he saidcome on thenivlombard said at lastwhat are we going to do when night comesvera didnt answer
he went on accusinglyyou havent thought of thatshe said helplesslywhat can we do
oh my god im frightenedphilip lombard said thoughtfullyits fine weather
there will be a moon
we must find a placeup by the top cliffs perhaps
we can sit there and wait for morning
we mustnt go to sleep we must watch the whole time
and if any one comes up toward us i shall shoothe pausedyoull be cold perhaps in that thin dressvera said with a raucous laughcold
i should be colder if i were deadphilip lombard said quietlyyes thats truevera moved restlessly
she saidi shall go mad if i sit here any longer
lets move aboutall rightthey paced slowly up and down along the line of the rocks overlooking the sea
the sun was dropping towards the west
the light was golden and mellow
it enveloped them in a golden glow
vera said with a sudden nervous little gigglepity we cant have a bathephilip was looking down towards the sea
he said abruptlywhats that there
you seeby that big rock
noa little farther to the rightvera stared
she saidit looks like somebodys clothesa bather eh lombard laughed
queer
i suppose its only seaweedvera saidlets go and lookit is clothes said lombard as they drew nearer
a bundle of them
thats a boot
come on lets scramble along herethey scrambled over the rocks
vera stopped suddenly
she saidits not clothesits a manthe man was wedged between two rocks flung there by the tide earlier in the day
lombard and vera reached it in a last scramble
they bent down
a purple discoloured facea hideous drowned facelombard saidmy god
its armstrongsixteeniaeons passed  worlds spun and whirled  time was motionless  it stood stillit passed through a thousand ages
no it was only a minute or so two people were standing looking down on a dead man
slowly very slowly vera claythorne and philip lombard lifted their heads and looked into each others eyes
iilombard laughed
he saidso thats it is it veravera saidtheres no one on the islandno one at allexcept us twoher voice was a whispernothing more
lombard saidprecisely
so we know where we are dont wevera saidhow was it workedthat trick with the marble bearhe shrugged his shoulders
a conjuring trick my deara very good onetheir eyes met again
vera thoughtwhy did i never see his face properly before
a wolfthats what it isa wolf s face  those horrible teethlombard said and his voice was a snarldangerousmenacingthis is the end you understand
weve come to the truth now
and its the endvera said quietlyi understandshe stared out to sea
general macarthur had stared out to seawhenonly yesterday
or was it the day before
he too had said this is the endhe had said it with acceptancealmost with welcome
but to vera the wordsthe thoughtbrought rebellion
no it should not be the end
she looked down at the dead man
she saidpoor dr armstronglombard sneered
he saidwhats this
womanly pityvera saidwhy not
havent you any pityhe saidive no pity for you
dont expect itvera looked down again at the body
she saidwe must move him
carry him up to the houseto join the other victims i suppose
all neat and tidy
as far as im concerned he can stay where he isvera saidat any rate lets get him out of the reach of the sealombard laughed
he saidif you likehe benttugging at the body
vera leaned against him helping him
she pulled and tugged with all her might
lombard pantednot such an easy jobthey managed it however drawing the body clear of high water mark
lombard said as he straightened upsatisfiedvera saidquiteher tone warned him
he spun round
even as he clapped his hand to his pocket he knew that he would find it empty
she had moved a yard or two away and was facing him revolver in hand
lombard saidso thats the reason for your womanly solicitude
you wanted to pick my pocketshe nodded
she held it steadily and unwaveringly
death was very near to philip lombard now
it had never he knew been nearer
nevertheless he was not beaten yet
he said authoritativelygive that revolver to mevera laughed
lombard saidcome on hand it overhis quick brain was working
which waywhich methodtalk her overlull her into security or a swift dashall his life lombard had taken the risky way
he took it now
he spoke slowly argumentativelynow look here my dear girl you just listenand then he sprang
quick as a pantheras any other feline creature
automatically vera pressed the trigger
lombards leaping body stayed poised in midspring then crashed heavily to the ground
vera came warily forward the revolver ready in her hand
but there was no need of caution
philip lombard was deadshot through the heart
iiirelief possessed veraenormous exquisite relief
at last it was over
there was no more fearno more steeling of her nerves
she was alone on the island
alone with nine dead bodies
but what did that matter
she was alive
she sat thereexquisitely happyexquisitely at peace no more fear
ivthe sun was setting when vera moved at last
sheer reaction had kept her immobile
there had been no room in her for anything but the glorious sense of safety
she realized now that she was hungry and sleepy
principally sleepy
she wanted to throw herself on her bed and sleep and sleep and sleep
tomorrow perhaps they would come and rescue herbut she didnt really mind
she didnt mind staying here
not now that she was alone
oh
blessed blessed peace
she got to her feet and glanced up at the house
nothing to be afraid of any longer
no terrors waiting for her
just an ordinary wellbuilt modern house
and yet a little earlier in the day she had not been able to look at it without shivering
fearwhat a strange thing fear was
well it was over now
she had conqueredhad triumphed over the most deadly peril
by her own quickwittedness and adroitness she had turned the tables on her wouldbe destroyer
she began to walk up towards the house
the sun was setting the sky to the west was streaked with red and orange
it was beautiful and peaceful
vera thought
the whole thing might be a dreamhow tired she wasterribly tired
her limbs ached her eyelids were dropping
not to be afraid anymore  to sleep
sleep  sleep  sleep
to sleep safely since she was alone on the island
one little soldier boy left all alone
she smiled to herself
she went in at the front door
the house too felt strangely peaceful
vera thoughtordinarily one wouldnt care to sleep where theres a dead body in practically every bedroomshould she go to the kitchen and get herself something to eat
she hesitated a moment then decided against it
she was really too tired
she paused by the dining room door
there were still three little china figures in the middle of the table
vera laughed
she saidyoure behind the times my dearsshe picked up two of them and tossed them out through the window
she heard them crash on the stone of the terrace
the third little figure she picked up and held in her hand
she saidyou can come with me
weve won my dear
weve wonthe hall was dim in the dying light
vera the little soldier clasped in her hand began to mount the stairs
slowly because her legs were suddenly very tired
one little soldier boy left all alone how did it end
oh yes
he got married and then there were nonemarried  funny how she suddenly got the feeling again that hugo was in the house
very strong
yes hugo was upstairs waiting for her
vera said to herselfdont be a fool
youre so tired that youre imagining the most fantastic thingsslowly up the stairs
at the top of them something fell from her hand making hardly any noise on the soft pile carpet
she did not notice that she had dropped the revolver
she was only conscious of clasping a little china figure
how very quiet the house was
and yetit didnt seem like an empty house
hugo upstairs waiting for her
one little soldier boy left all alone what was the last line again
something about being marriedor was it something else
she had come now to the door of her room
hugo was waiting for her insideshe was quite sure of it
she opened the door
she gave a gasp
what was thathanging from the hook in the ceiling
a rope with a noose all ready
and a chair to stand upona chair that could be kicked awaythat was what hugo wantedand of course that was the last line of the rhyme
he went and hanged himself and then there were nonethe little china figure fell from her hand
it rolled unheeded and broke against the fender
like an automaton vera moved forward
this was the endhere where the cold wet hand cyrils hand of course had touched her throat
you can go to the rock cyrilthat was what murder wasas easy as that
but afterwards you went on remembering
she climbed up on the chair her eyes staring in front of her like a sleepwalkers  she adjusted the noose round her neck
hugo was there to see she did what she had to do
she kicked away the chair
epiloguesir thomas legge assistant commissioner at scotland yard said irritablybut the whole things incredibleinspector maine said respectfullyi know sirthe ac went onten people dead on an island and not a living soul on it
it doesnt make senseinspector maine said stolidlynevertheless it happened sirsir thomas legge saiddam it all maine somebody must have killed emthats just our problem sirnothing helpful in the doctors reportno sir
wargrave and lombard were shot the first through the head the second through the heart
miss brent and marston died of cyanide poisoning
mrs rogers died of an overdose of chloral
rogers head was split open
blores head was crushed in
armstrong died of drowning
macarthurs skull was fractured by a blow on the back of the head and vera claythorne was hangedthe ac winced
he saidnasty businessall of ithe considered for a minute or two
he said irritablydo you mean to say that you havent been able to get anything helpful out of the sticklehaven people
dash it they must know somethinginspector maine shrugged his shoulders
theyre ordinary decent seafaring folk
they know that the island was bought by a man called owenand thats about all they do knowwho provisioned the island and made all the necessary arrangementsman called morris
isaac morrisand what does he say about it allhe cant say anything sir hes deadthe ac frowned
do we know anything about this morrisoh yes sir we know about him
he wasnt a very savoury gentleman mr morris
he was implicated in that sharepushing fraud of bennitos three years agowere sure of that though we cant prove it
and he was mixed up in the dope business
and again we cant prove it
he was a very careful man morrisand he was behind this island businessyes sir he put through the salethough he made it clear that he was buying soldier island for a third party unnamedsurely theres something to be found out on the financial angle thereinspector maine smiled
not if you knew morris
he can wangle figures until the best chartered accountant in the country wouldnt know if he was on his head or his heels
weve had a taste of that in the bennito business
no he covered his employers tracks all rightthe other man sighed
inspector maine went onit was morris who made all the arrangements down at sticklehaven
represented himself as acting for âmr
owen and it was he who explained to the people down there that there was some experiment onsome bet about living on a âdesert island for a weekand that no notice was to be taken of any appeal for help from out theresir thomas legge stirred uneasily
he saidand youre telling me that those people didnt smell a rat
not even thenmaine shrugged his shoulders
he saidyoure forgetting sir that soldier island previously belonged to young elmer robson the american
he had the most extraordinary parties down there
ive no doubt the local peoples eyes fairly popped out over them
but they got used to it and theyd begun to feel that anything to do with soldier island would necessarily be incredible
its natural that sir when you come to think of itthe assistant commissioner admitted gloomily that he supposed it was
maine saidfred narracottthats the man who took the party out theredid say one thing that was illuminating
he said he was surprised to see what sort of people these were
ânot at all like mr robsons parties i think it was the fact that they were all so normal and so quiet that made him override morriss orders and take out a boat to the island after hed heard about the sos signalswhen did he and the other men gothe signals were seen by a party of boy scouts on the morning of the 11th
there was no possibility of getting out there that day
the men got there on the afternoon of the 12th at the first moment possible to run a boat ashore there
theyre all quite positive that nobody could have left the island before they got there
there was a big sea on after the stormcouldnt someone have swum ashoreits over a mile to the coast and there were heavy seas and big breakers inshore
and there were a lot of people boy scouts and others on the cliffs looking out towards the island and watchingthe ac sighed
he saidwhat about that gramophone record you found in the house
couldnt you get hold of anything there that might helpinspector maine saidive been into that
it was supplied by a firm that do a lot of theatrical stuff and film effects
it was sent to u n owen esq co isaac morris and was understood to be required for the amateur performance of a hitherto unacted play
the typescript of it was returned with the recordlegge saidand what about the subject matter ehinspector maine said gravelyim coming to that sirhe cleared his throat
ive investigated those accusations as thoroughly as i can
starting with the rogerses who were the first to arrive on the island
they were in service with a miss brady who died suddenly
cant get anything definite out of the doctor who attended her
he says they certainly didnt poison her or anything like that but his personal belief is that there was some funny businessthat she died as the result of neglect on their part
says its the sort of thing thats quite impossible to prove
then there is mr justice wargrave
thats ok
he was the judge who sentenced seton
by the way seton was guiltyunmistakably guilty
evidence turned up later after he was hanged which proved that beyond any shadow of doubt
but there was a good deal of comment at the timenine people out of ten thought seton was innocent and that the judges summing up had been vindictive
the claythorne girl i find was governess in a family where a death occurred by drowning
however she doesnt seem to have had anything to do with it and as a matter of fact she behaved very well swam out to the rescue and was actually carried out to sea and only just rescued in timego on said the ac with a sigh
maine took a deep breath
dr
armstrong now
wellknown man
had a consultingroom in harley street
absolutely straight and aboveboard in his profession
havent been able to trace any record of an illegal operation or anything of that kind
its true that there was a woman called clees who was operated on by him way back in 1925 at leithmore when he was attached to the hospital there
peritonitis and she died on the operating table
maybe he wasnt very skilful over the opafter all he hadnt much experiencebut after all clumsiness isnt a criminal offence
there was certainly no motive
then theres miss emily brent
girl beatrice taylor was in service with her
got pregnant was turned out by her mistress and went and drowned herself
not a nice businessbut again not criminalthat said the ac seems to be the point
u n owen dealt with cases that the law couldnt touchmaine went stolidly on with his list
young marston was a fairly reckless car driverhad his licence endorsed twice and he ought to have been prohibited from driving in my opinion
thats all there is to him
the two names john and lucy combes were those of two kids he knocked down and killed near cambridge
some friends of his gave evidence for him and he was let off with a fine
cant find anything definite about general macarthur
fine recordwar serviceall the rest of it
arthur richmond was serving under him in france and was killed in action
no friction of any kind between him and the general
they were close friends as a matter of fact
there were some blunders made about that timecommanding officers sacrificed men unnecessarilypossibly this was a blunder of that kindpossibly said the ac
now philip lombard
lombard has been mixed up in some very curious shows abroad
hes sailed very near the law once or twice
got a reputation for daring and for not being overscrupulous
sort of fellow who might do several murders in some quiet out of the way spot
then we come to blore maine hesitated
he of course was one of our lotthe other man stirred
blore said the assistant commissioner forcibly was a bad hatyou think so sirthe ac saidi always thought so
but he was clever enough to get away with it
its my opinion that he committed black perjury in the landor case
i wasnt happy about it at the time
but i couldnt find anything
i put harris on to it and he couldnt find anything but im still of the opinion that there was something to find if wed known how to set about it
the man wasnt straightthere was a pause then sir thomas legge saidand isaac morris is dead you say
when did he diei thought youd soon come to that sir
isaac morris died on the night of august 8th
took an overdose of sleeping stuffone of the barbiturates i understand
there wasnt anything to show whether it was accident or suicidelegge said slowlycare to know what i think maineperhaps i can guess sirlegge said heavilythat death of morriss is a damned sight too opportuneinspector maine nodded
he saidi thought youd say that sirthe assistant commissioner brought down his fist with a bang on the table
he cried outthe whole things fantasticimpossible
ten people killed on a bare rock of an islandand we dont know who did it or why or howmaine coughed
he saidwell its not quite like that sir
we do know why more or less
some fanatic with a bee in his bonnet about justice
he was out to get people who were beyond the reach of the law
he picked ten peoplewhether they were really guilty or not doesnt matterthe commissioner stirred
he said sharplydoesnt it
it seems to mehe stopped
inspector maine waited respectfully
with a sigh legge shook his head
carry on he said
just for a minute i felt id got somewhere
got as it were the clue to the thing
its gone now
go ahead with what you were sayingmaine went onthere were ten people to beexecuted lets say
they were executed
u n owen accomplished his task
and somehow or other he spirited himself off that island into thin airthe ac saidfirstclass vanishing trick
but you know maine there must be an explanationmaine saidyoure thinking sir that if the man wasnt on the island he couldnt have left the island and according to the account of the interested parties he never was on the island
well then the only explanation possible is that he was actually one of the tenthe ac nodded
maine said earnestlywe thought of that sir
we went into it
now to begin with were not quite in the dark as to what happened on soldier island
vera claythorne kept a diary so did emily brent
old wargrave made some notesdry legal cryptic stuff but quite clear
and blore made notes too
all those accounts tally
the deaths occurred in this order
marston mrs rogers macarthur rogers miss brent wargrave
after his death vera claythornes diary states that armstrong left the house in the night and that blore and lombard had gone after him
blore has one more entry in his notebook
just two words
âarmstrong disappearednow sir it seemed to me taking everything into account that we might find here a perfectly good solution
armstrong was drowned you remember
granting that armstrong was mad what was to prevent him having killed off all the others and then committed suicide by throwing himself over the cliff or perhaps while trying to swim to the mainland
that was a good solutionbut it wont do
no sir it wont do
first of all theres the police surgeons evidence
he got to the island early on the morning of august 13
he couldnt say much to help us
all he could say was that all the people had been dead at least thirtysix hours and probably a good deal longer
but he was fairly definite about armstrong
said he must have been from eight to ten hours in the water before his body was washed up
that works out at this that armstrong must have gone into the sea sometime during the night of the 10thâ11thand ill explain why
we found the point where the body was washed upit had been wedged between two rocks and there were bits of cloth hair etc on them
it must have been deposited there at high water on the 11ththats to say round about 11 oclock am after that the storm subsided and succeeding high water marks are considerably lower
you might say i suppose that armstrong managed to polish off the other three before he went into the sea that night
but theres another point and one you cant get over
armstrongs body had been dragged above high water mark
we found it well above the reach of any tide
and it was laid out straight on the groundall neat and tidy
so that settles one point definitely
someone was alive on the island after armstrong was deadhe paused and then went on
and that leavesjust what exactly
heres the position early on the morning of the 11th
armstrong has âdisappeared drowned
that leaves us three people
lombard blore and vera claythorne
lombard was shot
his body was down by the seanear armstrongs
vera claythorne was found hanged in her own bedroom
blores body was on the terrace
his head was crushed in by a heavy marble clock that it seems reasonable to suppose fell on him from the window abovethe ac said sharplywhose windowvera claythornes
now sir lets take each of these cases separately
first philip lombard
lets say he pushed over that lump of marble on to blorethen he doped vera claythorne and strung her up
lastly he went down to the seashore and shot himself
but if so who took away the revolver from him
for that revolver was found up in the house just inside the door at the top of the stairswargraves roomthe ac saidany fingerprints on ityes sir vera claythornesbut man alive theni know what youre going to say sir
that it was vera claythorne
that she shot lombard took the revolver back to the house toppled the marble block on to blore and thenhanged herself
and thats quite all rightup to a point
theres a chair in her bedroom and on the seat of it there are marks of seaweed same as on her shoes
looks as though she stood on the chair adjusted the rope round her neck and kicked away the chair
but that chair wasnt found kicked over
it was like all the other chairs neatly put back against the wall
that was done after vera claythornes deathby someone else
that leaves us with blore and if you tell me that after shooting lombard and inducing vera claythorne to hang herself he then went out and pulled down a whacking great block of marble on himself by tying a string to it or something like thatwell i simply dont believe you
men dont commit suicide that wayand whats more blore wasnt that kind of man
we knew bloreand he was not the man that youd ever accuse of a desire for abstract justicethe assistant commissioner saidi agreeinspector maine saidand therefore sir there must have been someone else on the island
someone who tidied up when the whole business was over
but where was he all the timeand where did he go to
the sticklehaven people are absolutely certain that no one could have left the island before the rescue boat got there
but in that casehe stopped
the assistant commissioner saidin that casehe sighed
he shook his head
he leaned forward
but in that case he said who killed thema manuscript document sent to scotland yard by the master of the emma jane fishing trawlerfrom my earliest youth i realized that my nature was a mass of contradictions
i have to begin with an incurably romantic imagination
the practice of throwing a bottle into the sea with an important document inside was one that never failed to thrill me when reading adventure stories as a child
it thrills me stilland for that reason i have adopted this coursewriting my confession enclosing it in a bottle sealing the latter and casting it into the waves
there is i suppose a hundred to one chance that my confession may be foundand then or do i flatter myself
a hitherto unsolved murder mystery will be explained
i was born with other traits besides my romantic fancy
i have a definite sadistic delight in seeing or causing death
i remember experiments with waspswith various garden pests  from an early age i knew very strongly the lust to kill
but side by side with this went a contradictory traita strong sense of justice
it is abhorrent to me that an innocent person or creature should suffer or die by any act of mine
i have always felt strongly that right should prevail
it may be understoodi think a psychologist would understandthat with my mental makeup being what it was i adopted the law as a profession
the legal profession satisfied nearly all my instincts
crime and its punishment has always fascinated me
i enjoy reading every kind of detective story and thriller
i have devised for my own private amusement the most ingenious ways of carrying out a murder
when in due course i came to preside over a court of law that other secret instinct of mine was encouraged to develop
to see a wretched criminal squirming in the dock suffering the tortures of the damned as his doom came slowly and slowly nearer was to me an exquisite pleasure
mind you i took no pleasure in seeing an innocent man there
on at least two occasions i stopped cases where to my mind the accused was palpably innocent directing the jury that there was no case
thanks however to the fairness and efficiency of our police force the majority of the accused persons who have come before me to be tried for murder have been guilty
i will say here that such was the case with the man edward seton
his appearance and manner were misleading and he created a good impression on the jury
but not only the evidence which was clear though unspectacular but my own knowledge of criminals told me without any doubt that the man had actually committed the crime with which he was charged the brutal murder of an elderly woman who trusted him
i have a reputation as a hanging judge but that is unfair
i have always been strictly just and scrupulous in my summing up of a case
all i have done is to protect the jury against the emotional effect of emotional appeals by some of our more emotional counsel
i have drawn their attention to the actual evidence
for some years past i have been aware of a change within myself a lessening of controla desire to act instead of to judge
i have wantedlet me admit it franklyto commit a murder myself
i recognized this as the desire of the artist to express himself
i was or could be an artist in crime
my imagination sternly checked by the exigencies of my profession waxed secretly to colossal force
i musti musti mustcommit a murder
and what is more it must be no ordinary murder
it must be a fantastical crimesomething stupendousout of the common
in that one respect i have still i think an adolescents imagination
i wanted something theatrical impossible
i wanted to kill  yes i wanted to kill
butincongruous as it may seem to somei was restrained and hampered by my innate sense of justice
the innocent must not suffer
and then quite suddenly the idea came to mestarted by a chance remark uttered during casual conversation
it was a doctor to whom i was talkingsome ordinary undistinguished gp
he mentioned casually how often murder must be committed which the law was unable to touch
and he instanced a particular casethat of an old lady a patient of his who had recently died
he was he said himself convinced that her death was due to the withholding of a restorative drug by a married couple who attended on her and who stood to benefit very substantially by her death
that sort of thing he explained was quite impossible to prove but he was nevertheless quite sure of it in his own mind
he added that there were many cases of a similar nature going on all the timecases of deliberate murderand all quite untouchable by the law
that was the beginning of the whole thing
i suddenly saw my way clear
and i determined to commit not one murder but murder on a grand scale
a childish rhyme of my infancy came back into my mindthe rhyme of the ten little soldier boys
it had fascinated me as a child of twothe inexorable diminishmentthe sense of inevitability
i began secretly to collect victims
i will not take up space here by going into details of how this was accomplished
i had a certain routine line of conversation which i employed with nearly every one i metand the results i got were really surprising
during the time i was in a nursing home i collected the case of dr armstronga violently teetotal sister who attended on me being anxious to prove to me the evils of drink by recounting to me a case many years ago in hospital when a doctor under the influence of alcohol had killed a patient on whom he was operating
a careless question as to where the sister in question had trained etc soon gave me the necessary data
i tracked down the doctor and the patient mentioned without difficulty
a conversation between two old military gossips in my club put me on the track of general macarthur
a man who had recently returned from the amazon gave me a devastating rÃ©sumÃ© of the activities of one philip lombard
an indignant memsahib in majorca recounted the tale of the puritan emily brent and her wretched servant girl
anthony marston i selected from a large group of people who had committed similar offences
his complete callousness and his inability to feel any responsibility for the lives he had taken made him i considered a type dangerous to the community and unfit to live
exinspector blore came my way quite naturally some of my professional brethren discussing the landor case with freedom and vigour
i took a serious view of his offence
the police as servants of the law must be of a high order of integrity
for their word is perforce believed by virtue of their profession
finally there was the case of vera claythorne
it was when i was crossing the atlantic
at a late hour one night the sole occupants of the smoking room were myself and a goodlooking young man called hugo hamilton
hugo hamilton was unhappy
to assuage that unhappiness he had taken a considerable quantity of drink
he was in the maudlin confidential stage
without much hope of any result i automatically started my routine conversational gambit
the response was startling
i can remember his words now
he saidyoure right
murder isnt what most people thinkgiving someone a dollop of arsenicpushing them over a cliffthat sort of stuff he leaned forward thrusting his face into mine
he said ive known a murderessknown her i tell you
and whats more i was crazy about her  god help me sometimes i think i still am  its hell i tell youhell
you see she did it more or less for me  not that i ever dreamed  women are fiendsabsolute fiendsyou wouldnt think a girl like thata nice straight jolly girlyou wouldnt think shed do that would you
that shed take a kid out to sea and let it drownyou wouldnt think a woman could do a thing like thati said to himare you sure she did do ithe said and in saying it he seemed suddenly to sober upim quite sure
nobody else ever thought of it
but i knew the moment i looked at herwhen i got backafter  and she knew i knew  what she didnt realize was that i loved that kidhe didnt say anymore but it was easy enough for me to trace back the story and reconstruct it
i needed a tenth victim
i found him in a man named morris
he was a shady little creature
amongst other things he was a dope pedlar and he was responsible for inducing the daughter of friends of mine to take to drugs
she committed suicide at the age of twentyone
during all this time of search my plan had been gradually maturing in my mind
it was now complete and the coping stone to it was an interview i had with a doctor in harley street
i have mentioned that i underwent an operation
my interview in harley street told me that another operation would be useless
my medical adviser wrapped up the information very prettily but i am accustomed to getting at the truth of a statement
i did not tell the doctor of my decisionthat my death should not be a slow and protracted one as it would be in the course of nature
no my death should take place in a blaze of excitement
i would live before i died
and now to the actual mechanics of the crime of soldier island
to acquire the island using the man morris to cover my tracks was easy enough
he was an expert in that sort of thing
tabulating the information i had collected about my prospective victims i was able to concoct a suitable bait for each
none of my plans miscarried
all my guests arrived at soldier island on the 8th of august
the party included myself
morris was already accounted for
he suffered from indigestion
before leaving london i gave him a capsule to take last thing at night which had i said done wonders for my own gastric juices
he accepted unhesitatinglythe man was a slight hypochondriac
i had no fear that he would leave any compromising documents or memoranda behind
he was not that sort of man
the order of death upon the island had been subjected by me to special thought and care
there were i considered amongst my guests varying degrees of guilt
those whose guilt was the lightest should i decided pass out first and not suffer the prolonged mental strain and fear that the more coldblooded offenders were to suffer
anthony marston and mrs rogers died first the one instantaneously the other in a peaceful sleep
marston i recognized was a type born without that feeling of moral responsibility which most of us have
he was amoralpagan
mrs rogers i had no doubt had acted very largely under the influence of her husband
i need not describe closely how those two met their deaths
the police will have been able to work that out quite easily
potassium cyanide is easily obtained by householders for putting down wasps
i had some in my possession and it was easy to slip it into marstons almost empty glass during the tense period after the gramophone recital
i may say that i watched the faces of my guests closely during that indictment and i had no doubt whatever after my long court experience that one and all were guilty
during recent bouts of pain i had been ordered a sleeping draughtchloral hydrate
it had been easy for me to suppress this until i had a lethal amount in my possession
when rogers brought up some brandy for his wife he set it down on a table and in passing that table i put the stuff into the brandy
it was easy for at that time suspicion had not begun to set in
general macarthur met his death quite painlessly
he did not hear me come up behind him
i had of course to choose my time for leaving the terrace very carefully but everything was successful
as i had anticipated a search was made of the island and it was discovered that there was no one on it but our seven selves
that at once created an atmosphere of suspicion
according to my plan i should shortly need an ally
i selected dr armstrong for that part
he was a gullible sort of man he knew me by sight and reputation and it was inconceivable to him that a man of my standing should actually be a murderer
all his suspicions were directed against lombard and i pretended to concur in these
i hinted to him that i had a scheme by which it might be possible to trap the murderer into incriminating himself
though a search had been made of everyones room no search had as yet been made of the persons themselves
but that was bound to come soon
i killed rogers on the morning of august 10th
he was chopping sticks for lighting the fire and did not hear me approach
i found the key to the dining room door in his pocket
he had locked it the night before
in the confusion attending the finding of rogers body i slipped into lombards room and abstracted his revolver
i knew that he would have one with himin fact i had instructed morris to suggest as much when he interviewed him
at breakfast i slipped my last dose of chloral into miss brents coffee when i was refilling her cup
we left her in the dining room
i slipped in there a little while latershe was nearly unconscious and it was easy to inject a strong solution of cyanide into her
the bumble bee business was really rather childishbut somehow you know it pleased me
i liked adhering as closely as possible to my nursery rhyme
immediately after this what i had already foreseen happenedindeed i believe i suggested it myself
we all submitted to a rigorous search
i had safely hidden away the revolver and had no more cyanide or chloral in my possession
it was then that i intimated to armstrong that we must carry our plan into effect
it was simply thisi must appear to be the next victim
that would perhaps rattle the murdererat any rate once i was supposed to be dead i could move about the house and spy upon the unknown murderer
armstrong was keen on the idea
we carried it out that evening
a little plaster of red mud on the foreheadthe red curtain and the wool and the stage was set
the lights of the candles were very flickering and uncertain and the only person who would examine me closely was armstrong
it worked perfectly
miss claythorne screamed the house down when she found the seaweed which i had thoughtfully arranged in her room
they all rushed up and i took up my pose of a murdered man
the effect on them when they found me was all that could be desired
armstrong acted his part in the most professional manner
they carried me upstairs and laid me on my bed
nobody worried about me they were all too deadly scared and terrified of each other
i had a rendezvous with armstrong outside the house at a quarter to two
i took him up a little way behind the house on the edge of the cliff
i said that here we could see if any one else approached us and we should not be seen from the house as the bedrooms faced the other way
he was still quite unsuspiciousand yet he ought to have been warnedif he had only remembered the words of the nursery rhyme
a red herring swallowed one  he took the red herring all right
it was quite easy
i uttered an exclamation leant over the cliff told him to look wasnt that the mouth of a cave
he leant right over
a quick vigorous push sent him off his balance and splash into the heaving sea below
i returned to the house
it must have been my footfall that blore heard
a few minutes after i had returned to armstrongs room i left it this time making a certain amount of noise so that someone should hear me
i heard a door open as i got to the bottom of the stairs
they must have just glimpsed my figure as i went out of the front door
it was a minute or two before they followed me
i had gone straight round the house and in at the dining room window which i had left open
i shut the window and later i broke the glass
then i went upstairs and laid myself out again on my bed
i calculated that they would search the house again but i did not think they would look closely at any of the corpses a mere twitch aside of the sheet to satisfy themselves that it was not armstrong masquerading as a body
this is exactly what occurred
i forgot to say that i returned the revolver to lombards room
it may be of interest to someone to know where it was hidden during the search
there was a big pile of tinned food in the larder
i opened the bottommost of the tinsbiscuits i think it contained bedded in the revolver and replaced the strip of adhesive tape
i calculated and rightly that no one would think of working their way through a pile of apparently untouched foodstuffs especially as all the top tins were soldered
the red curtain i had concealed by laying it flat on the seat of one of the drawing room chairs under the chintz cover and the wool in the seat cushion cutting a small hole
and now came the moment that i had anticipatedthree people who were so frightened of each other that anything might happenand one of them had a revolver
i watched them from the windows of the house
when blore came up alone i had the big marble clock poised ready
exit blorefrom my window i saw vera claythorne shoot lombard
a daring and resourceful young woman
i always thought she was a match for him and more
as soon as that had happened i set the stage in her bedroom
it was an interesting psychological experiment
would the consciousness of her own guilt the state of nervous tension consequent on having just shot a man be sufficient together with the hypnotic suggestion of the surroundings to cause her to take her own life
i thought it would
i was right
vera claythorne hanged herself before my eyes where i stood in the shadow of the wardrobe
and now for the last stage
i came forward picked up the chair and set it against the wall
i looked for the revolver and found it at the top of the stairs where the girl had dropped it
i was careful to preserve her fingerprints on it
and now
i shall finish writing this
i shall enclose it and seal it in a bottle and i shall throw the bottle into the sea
why
yes why
it was my ambition to invent a murder mystery that no one could solve
but no artist i now realize can be satisfied with art alone
there is a natural craving for recognition which cannot be gainsaid
i have let me confess it in all humility a pitiful human wish that someone should know just how clever i have been
in all this i have assumed that the mystery of soldier island will remain unsolved
it may be of course that the police will be cleverer than i think
there are after all three clues
one the police are perfectly aware that edward seton was guilty
they know therefore that one of the ten people on the island was not a murderer in any sense of the word and it follows paradoxically that that person must logically be the murderer
the second clue lies in the seventh verse of the nursery rhyme
armstrongs death is associated with a red herring which he swallowedor rather which resulted in swallowing him
that is to say that at that stage of the affair some hocuspocus is clearly indicatedand that armstrong was deceived by it and sent to his death
that might start a promising line of inquiry
for at that period there are only four persons and of those four i am clearly the only one likely to inspire him with confidence
the third is symbolical
the manner of my death marking me on the forehead
the brand of cain
there is i think little more to say
after entrusting my bottle and its message to the sea i shall go to my room and lay myself down on the bed
to my eyeglasses is attached what seems a length of fine black cordbut it is elastic cord
i shall lay the weight of the body on the glasses
the cord i shall loop round the door handle and attach it not too solidly to the revolver
what i think will happen is this
my hand protected with a handkerchief will press the trigger
my hand will fall to my side the revolver pulled by the elastic will recoil to the door jarred by the door handle it will detach itself from the elastic and fall
the elastic released will hang down innocently from the eyeglasses on which my body is lying
a handkerchief lying on the floor will cause no comment whatever
i shall be found laid neatly on my bed shot through the forehead in accordance with the record kept by my fellow victims
times of death cannot be stated with any accuracy by the time our bodies are examined
when the sea goes down there will come from the mainland boats and men
and they will find ten dead bodies and an unsolved problem on soldier island
