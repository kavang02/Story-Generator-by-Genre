sunset towers  the sun sets in the west just about everyone knows that but sunset towers faced east
strange
sunset towers faced east and had no towers
this glittery glassy apartment house stood alone on the lake michigan shore five stories high
five empty stories high
then one day it happened to be the fourth of july a most uncommonlooking delivery boy rode around town slipping letters under the doors of the chosen tenantstobe
the letters were signed barney northrup
the delivery boy was sixtytwo years old and there was no such person as barney northrup

take a look at all that glass
oneway glass barney northrup said
you can see out nobody can see in looking up the wexlers the first appointment of the day were blinded by the blast of morning sun that flashed off the face of the building
see those chandeliers
crystal barney northrup said slicking his black moustache and straightening his handpainted tie in the lobbys mirrored wall
how about this carpeting
three inches thick gorgeous mrs wexler replied clutching her husbands arm as her high heels wobbled in the deep plush pile
she too  managed an approving glance in the mirror before the elevator door opened
youre really in luck barney northrup said
theres only one apartment left but youll love it
it was meant for you he flung open the door to 3d
now is that breathtaking or is that breathtaking mrs wexler gasped it was breathtaking all right
two walls of the living room were floortoceiling glass
following barney northrups lead she oohed and aahed her joyous way through the entire apartment
her trailing husband was less enthusiastic
whats this a bedroom or a closet jake wexler asked peering into the last room
its a bedroom of course his wife replied
it looks like a closet oh jake this apartment is perfect for us just perfect grace wexler argued in a whining coo
the third bedroom was a trifle small but it would do just fine for turtle
and think what it means having your office in the lobby jake no more driving to and from work no more mowing the lawn or shoveling snow let me remind you barney northrup said the rent here is cheaper than what your old house costs in upkeep how would he know that jake wondered
grace stood before the front window where beyond the road beyond the trees lake michigan lay calm and glistening
a lake view
just wait until those socalled friends of hers with their classy houses see this place
the furniture would have to be reupholstered no shed buy new furniture beige velvet
and shed have stationery madeblue with a  deckle edge her name and fancy address in swirling type across the top grace windsor wexler sunset towers on the lake shore
not every tenanttobe was quite as overjoyed as grace windsor wexler
arriving in the late afternoon sydelle pulaski looked up and saw only the dim warped reflections of treetops and drifting clouds in the glass face of sunset towers
youre really in luck barney northrup said for the sixth and last time
theres only one apartment left but youll love it
it was meant for you he flung open the door to a onebedroom apartment in the rear
now is that breathtaking or is that breathtaking not especially sydelle pulaski replied as she blinked into the rays of the summer sun setting behind the parking lot
she had waited all these years for a place of her own and here it was in an elegant building where rich people lived
but she wanted a lake view
the front apartments are taken barney northrup said
besides the rents too steep for a secretarys salary
believe me you get the same luxuries here at a third of the price at least the view from the side window was pleasant
are you sure nobody can see in sydelle pulaski asked
absolutely barney northrup said following her suspicious stare to the mansion on the north cliff
thats just the old westing house up there it hasnt been lived in for fifteen years well ill have to think it over  i have twenty people begging for this apartment barney northrup said lying through his buckteeth
take it or leave it ill take it whoever whatever else he was barney northrup was a good salesman
in one day he had rented all of sunset towers to the people whose names were already printed on the mailboxes in an alcove off the lobby office lobby 2c 2d 3c 3d 4c 4d 5  dr wexler theodorakis coffee shop f baumbach theodorakis s pulaski wexler hoo j j ford shin hoos restaurant  who were these people these specially selected tenants
they were mothers and fathers and children
a dressmaker a secretary an inventor a doctor a judge
and oh yes one was a bookie one was a burglar one was a bomber and one was a mistake
barney northrup had rented one of the apartments to the wrong person
2  ghosts or worse  on september first the chosen ones and the mistake moved in
a wire fence had been erected along the north side of the building on it a sign warned no trespassingproperty of the westing estate
the newly paved driveway curved sharply and doubled back on itself rather than breach the citycounty line
sunset towers stood at the far edge of town
on september second shin hoos restaurant specializing in authentic chinese cuisine held its grand opening
only three people came
it was indeed an exclusive neighborhood too exclusive for mr hoo
however the less expensive coffee shop that opened on the parking lot was kept busy serving breakfast lunch and dinner to tenants ordering up and to workers from nearby westingtown
sunset towers was a quiet wellrun building and except for the grumbling mr hoo the people who lived there seemed content
neighbor greeted neighbor with good morning or good evening or a friendly smile and grappled with small problems behind closed doors
the big problems were yet to come
now it was the end of october
a cold raw wind whipped dead leaves about the ankles of the four people grouped in the sunset towers driveway but not one of them shivered
not yet
the stocky broadshouldered man in the doormans uniform standing with feet spread fists on hips was sandy mcsouthers
the two slim trim highschool seniors shielding their eyes against the stinging chill were theo theodorakis and doug hoo
the small wiry man pointing to the house on the hill was otis amber the sixtytwoyearold delivery boy
they faced north gaping like statues cast in the moment of discovery until turtle wexler her kite tail of a braid flying behind her raced her bicycle into the driveway
look
look theres smoketheres smoke coming from the chimney of the westing house the others had seen it
what did she think they were looking at anyway
turtle leaned on the handlebars panting for breath
sunset towers was near excellent schools as barney northrup had promised but the junior high was four miles away
do you thinkdo you think old man westings up there naw otis amber the old delivery boy answered
nobodys seen him for years
supposed to be living on a private island in the south seas he is but most folks say hes dead
longgone dead
they say his corpse is still up there in that big old house
they say his body is sprawled out on a fancy oriental rug and his flesh is rotting off those mean bones and maggots are creeping in his eye sockets and crawling out his nose holes the delivery boy added a highpitched hehehe to the gruesome details
now someone shivered
it was turtle
serves him right sandy said
at other times a cheery fellow the doorman often complained bitterly about having  been fired from his job of twenty years in the westing paper mill
but somebody must be up there
somebody alive that is he pushed back the goldbraided cap and squinted at the house through his steelframed glasses as if expecting the curling smoke to write the answer in the autumn air
maybe its those kids again
no it couldnt be what kids the three kids wanted to know
why those two unfortunate fellas from westingtown what unfortunate fellas the three heads twisted from the doorman to the delivery boy
doug hoo ducked turtles whizzing braid
touch her precious pigtail even by accident and shell kick you in the shins the brat
he couldnt chance an injury to his legs not with the big meet coming
the track star began to jog in place
horrible it was horrible otis amber said with a shudder that sent the loose straps of his leather aviators helmet swinging about his long thin face
come to think of it it happened exactly one year ago tonight
on halloween what happened theo theodorakis asked impatiently
he was late for work in the coffee shop
tell them otis sandy urged
the delivery boy stroked the gray stubble on his pointed chin
seems it all started with a bet somebody bet them a dollar they couldnt stay in that spooky house five minutes
one measly buck
the poor kids hardly got through those french doors on this side of the westing house when they came tearing out like they was being chased by a ghost
chased by a ghostor worse  or worse
turtle forgot her throbbing toothache
theo theodorakis and doug hoo older and more worldlywise exchanged winks but stayed to hear the rest of the story
one fella ran out crazylike screaming his head off
he never stopped screaming til he hit the rocks at the bottom of the cliff
the other fella hasnt said but two words since
something about purple sandy helped him out
purple waves otis amber nodded sadly
yep that poor fella just sits in the state asylum saying purple waves purple waves over and over again and his scared eyes keep staring at his hands
you see when he came running out of the westing house his hands was dripping with warm red blood now all three shivered
poor kid the doorman said
all that pain and suffering for a dollar bet make it two dollars for each minute i stay in there and youre on turtle said
someone was spying on the group in the driveway
from the front window of apartment 2d fifteenyearold chris theodorakis watched his brother theo shake hands it must be a bet with the skinny onepigtailed girl and rush into the lobby
the family coffee shop would be busy now his brother should have been working the counter half an hour ago
chris checked the wall clock
two more hours before theo would bring up his dinner
then he would tell him about the limper
earlier that afternoon chris had followed the flight of a purple martin progne subis across the field of brambles  through the oaks up to the red maple on the hill
the bird flew off but something else caught his eye
someone he could not tell if the person was a man or a woman came out of the shadows on the lawn unlocked the french doors and disappeared into the westing house
someone with a limp
minutes later smoke began to rise from the chimney
once again chris turned toward the side window and scanned the house on the cliff
the french doors were closed heavy drapes hung full against the seventeen windows he had counted so many times
they didnt need drapes on the special glass windows here in sunset towers
he could see out but nobody could see in
then why did he sometimes feel that someone was watching him
who could be watching him
god
if god was watching then why was he like this
the binoculars fell to the boys lap
his head jerked his body coiled lashed by violent spasms
relax theo will come soon
relax soon the geese will be flying south in a v canada goose branta canadensis
relax
relax and watch the wind tangle the smoke and blow it toward westingtown
3  tenants in and out  upstairs in 3d angela wexler stood on a hassock as still and blankfaced pretty as a storewindow dummy
her pale blue eyes stared unblinkingly at the lake
turn dear said flora baumbach the dressmaker who lived and worked in a smaller apartment on the second floor
angela pivoted in a slow quarter turn
oh startled by the small cry flora baumbach dropped the pin from her pudgy fingers and almost swallowed the three in her mouth
please be careful mrs baumbach my angela has very delicate skin grace windsor wexler was supervising the fitting of her daughters wedding dress from the beige velvet couch
above her hung the twodozen framed flower prints she had selected and arranged with the greatest of taste and care
she could have been an interior decorator a good one too if it wasnt for the pressing demands of so on and so forth
mrs
baumbach didnt prick me mother angela said evenly
i was just surprised to see smoke coming from the westing house chimney crawling with slow caution on her hands and knees flora baumbach paused in the search for the dropped pin to peer up through her straight gray bangs
mrs wexler set her coffee cup on the driftwood coffee table and craned her neck for a better view
we must have new neighbors ill have to drive up there with a housewarming gift they may need some decorating advice hey look
theres smoke coming from the westing house again turtle was late with the news
oh its you mrs wexler always seemed surprised to see her other daughter so unlike goldenhaired angelfaced angela
flora baumbach about to rise with the found pin quickly sank down again to protect her sore shin in the shag carpeting
she had pulled turtles braid in the lobby yesterday
otis amber says that old man westings stinking corpse is rotting on an oriental rug my oh my flora baumbach exclaimed and mrs wexler clicked her tongue in an irritated tsk turtle decided not to go on with the horror story
not that her mother cared if she got killed or ended up a raving lunatic
mrs
baumbach could you hem my witchs costume
i need it for tonight mrs wexler answered
cant you see shes busy with angelas wedding dress
and why must you wear a silly costume like that
really turtle i dont know why you insist on making yourself ugly its no sillier than a wedding dress turtle snapped back
besides nobody gets married anymore and if they do they dont wear silly wedding dresses she was close to a tantrum
besides who would want to marry that stuckupknowitallmarshmallowfacedoctordenton… thats enough of your smart mouth mrs wexler leaped up hand ready to strike instead she straightened a framed flower print patted her fashionable honeyblonde hairdo and sat down again
she had never hit turtle but one of these daysbesides a stranger was present
doctor deere is a brilliant young man she explained for flora baumbachs ears
the dressmaker smiled politely
angela will soon be angela deere isnt that a precious name the dressmaker nodded
and then well have two doctors in the family
now where do you think youre going  turtle was at the front door
downstairs to tell daddy about the smoke coming from the westing house come back this instant
you know your father operates in the afternoon why dont you go to your room and work on stock market reports or whatever you do in there some room its even too small for a closet ill hem your witchs costume turtle angela offered
mrs wexler beamed on her perfect child draped in white
what an angel crows clothes were black her skin dead white
she looked severe
rigid in fact
rigid and righteously severe
no one could have guessed that under that stern facade her stomach was doing flipflops as doctor wexler cut out a corn
staring down at the fine lines of pink scalp that showed through the podiatrists thinning light brown hair did nothing to ease her queasiness so softly humming a hymn she settled her gaze on the north window
smoke watch it jake wexler almost cut off her little toe along with the corn
unaware of the near amputation the cleaning woman stared at the westing house
if you will just sit back jake began but his patient did not hear him
she must have been a handsome woman at one time but life had used her harshly
her faded hair knotted in a tight bun on the nape of her gaunt neck glinted goldred in the light
her profile was fine marred only by the jut of her clenched jaw
well lets get on with it friday was his busy day he had phone calls to make
please sit back mrs crow
im almost finished  what jake gently replaced her foot on the chairs pedestal
i see youve hurt your shin what for an instant their eyes met then she looked away
a shy creature or a guilty one crow averted her face when she spoke
your daughter turtle kicked me she muttered staring once again at the westing house
thats what happens when there is no religion in the home
sandy says westings corpse is up there rotting away on an oriental rug but i dont believe it
if hes truly dead then hes roasting in hell
we are sinners all what do you mean his corpse is rotting on an oriental rug some kind of persian rug maybe a chinese rug mr hoo joined his son at the glass sidewall of the fifth floor restaurant
and why were you wasting precious time listening to an overaged delivery boy with an overactive imagination when you should have been studying it was not a question dougs father never asked questions
dont shrug at me go study sure dad doug jogged off through the kitchen it was no use arguing that there was no school tomorrow just track practice
he jogged down the back stairs no matter what excuse he gave go study his father would say go study he jogged into the hoos rear apartment stretched out on the bare floor and repeated go study to twenty situps
only two customers were expected for the dinner hour shin hoos restaurant could seat one hundred
mr hoo slammed the reservations book shut pressed a hand against the pain in his ample stomach unwrapped a chocolate bar and devoured it quickly before acid etched another ulcer
back  home again is he
well westing wont get off so easy this time not on his life
a small delicate woman in a long white apron stood in silence before the restaurants east window
she stared longingly into the boundless gray distance as if far far on the other side of lake michigan lay china
sandy mcsouthers saluted as the maroon mercedes swung around the curved driveway and came to a stop at the entrance
he opened the car door with a ceremony reserved only for judge j j ford
look up there judge
theres smoke coming from the westing house a tall black woman in a tailored suit her shortclipped hair touched with gray slipped out from behind the wheel handed the car keys to the doorman and cast a disinterested glance at the house on the hill
they say nobodys up there just the corpse of old man westing rotting away on an oriental rug sandy reported as he hoisted a full briefcase from the trunk of the car
do you believe in ghosts judge there is certain to be a more rational explanation youre right of course judge sandy opened the heavy glass door and followed on the judges heels through the lobby
i was just repeating what otis amber said otis amber is a stupid man if not downright mad j j ford hurried into the elevator
she should not have said that not her not the first black the first woman to have been elected to a judgeship in the state
she was tired after a trying day that was it
or was it
so sam westing has come home at last
well she could sell the car take out a bank loan pay him  backin cash
but would he take it
please dont repeat what i said about otis amber mr mcsouthers dont worry judge the doorman escorted her to the door of apartment 4d
what you tell me is strictly confidential and it was
j j ford was the biggest tipper in sunset towers
i saw somebbb… chris theodorakis was too excited to stutter out the news to his brother
one arm shot out and twisted up over his head
dumb arm
theo squatted next to the wheelchair
listen chris ill tell you about that haunted castle on the hill his voice was soothing and hushed in mystery
somebody is up there chris but nobody is there just rich mr westing and hes dead
dead as a squashed june bug and rotting away on a motheaten oriental rug chris relaxed as he always did when his brother told him a story
theo was good at making up stories
and the worms are crawling in and out of the dead mans skull in and out of his ear holes his nose holes his mouth holes in and out of all his holes chris laughed then quickly composed his face
he was supposed to look scared
theo leaned closer
and high above the putrid corpse a crystal chandelier is tinkling
it tinkles and twinkles but not one breath of air stirs in that gloomy tomb of a room gloomy tomb of a roomtheo will make a good writer someday chris thought
he wouldnt spoil this wonderful spooky halloween story by telling him about the real person up there the one with the limp
so chris sat quietly his body at ease and heard about ghosts and ghouls and purple waves and smiled at his brother with pure delight
a smile that could break your heart sydelle pulaski the tenant in 3c always said
but no one paid any attention to sydelle pulaski
sydelle pulaski struggled out of the taxi large end first
she was not a heavy woman just widehipped from years of secretarial sitting
if only there was a ladylike way to get out of a cab
her green rhinestonestudded glasses slipped down her fleshy nose as she grappled with a tall triangular package and a stuffed shopping bag
if only that lazy driver would lend her a hand
not for a nickel tip he wouldnt
the cabbie slammed the back door and sped around the curved driveway narrowly missing the mercedes that sandy was driving to the parking lot
at least the nevertherewhenyouneedhim doorman had propped open the front door
not that he ever helped her or noticed her for that matter
no one ever noticed
sydelle pulaski limped through the lobby
she could be carrying a highpowered rifle in that package and no one would notice
she had moved to sunset towers hoping to meet elegant people but no one had invited her in for so much as a cup of tea
no one paid any attention to her except that poor crippled boy whose smile could break your heart and that bratty kid with the braidshell be sorry she kicked her in the shin
juggling her load earrings jingling and charm bracelet jangling sydelle pulaski unlocked the several locks to apartment 3c and bolted the door behind her
thered be fewer burglaries around here if people listened to her about putting in deadbolt locks
but nobody listened
nobody cared
on the plasticcovered dining table she set out the contents of the shopping bag six cans of enamel paint thinner and brushes
she unwrapped the long package and leaned four wooden crutches against the wall
the sun was setting over the parking lot but sydelle pulaski did not look out her back window
from the side window smoke could be seen rising from the westing house but sydelle pulaski did not notice
no one ever notices sydelle pulaski she muttered but now they will
now they will  4  the corpse found  the halloween moon was full
except for her receding chin turtle wexler looked every inch the witch her dark unbraided hair streaming wild in the wind from under her peaked hat a putty wart pasted on her small beaked nose
if only she could fly to the westing house on a broomstick instead of scrambling over rocks on all fours what with all she had to carry
under the long black cape the pockets of her jeans bulged with necessities for the nights dangerous vigil
doug hoo had already reached the top of the cliff and taken his station behind the maple on the lawn
the track star was chosen timekeeper because he could run faster than anyone in the state of wisconsin
here she comes its about time
shivering kneedeep in damp leaves that couldnt do his leg muscles much good he readied his thumb on the button of the stopwatch
turtle squinted into the blackness that lay within the open french doors
open as though someone or some thing was expecting her
theres no such thing as a ghost besides all you had to do was speak friendlylike to them
ghosts like dogs know when a persons scared
ghosts or worse otis amber had said
well not even the worse could hurt turtle wexler
she was pure of heart and deed she only kicked shins in selfdefense so that couldnt count against her
she wasnt scared she was not scared
hurry up that was doug from behind the tree
at two dollars a minute twentyfive minutes would pay for a subscription to the wall street journal
she could stay all night
she was prepared
turtle checked her pockets two sandwiches sandys flask filled with orange pop a flashlight her mothers silver cross to ward off vampires
the putty wart on her nose soaked in angelas perfume in the event she was locked up with the stinking corpse was clogging her nostrils with sticky sweetness
turtle took a deep breath of chill night air and flinched with pain
she was afraid of dentists not ghosts or…dont think about purple waves think about two dollars a minute
now onetwothreethree and a half go
doug checked his stopwatch
nine minutes
ten minutes
eleven minutes
suddenly a terrified screama young girls scream pierced the night
should he go in or was this one of the brats tricks
another scream closer
eeeeeeeeee clutching the bunched cape around her waist turtle came hurtling out of the westing house
eeeeeeeeee turtle had seen the corpse in the westing house but it was not rotting and it was not sprawled on an oriental rug
the dead man was tucked in a fourposter bed
a throbbing whisper purple purple or was it turtle turtlewhatever it was it was scary had beckoned her to the master bedroom on the second floor and… maybe it was a dream
no it couldnt be she ached all over from the tumble down the stairs
the moon was down the window dark
turtle lay in the narrow bed in her narrow room waiting dark still dark waiting
at last slow morning crept up the cliff and raised the westing house the house of whispers the house of death
two dollars times twelve minutes equals twentyfour dollars
thud
the morning newspaper was flung against the front door
turtle tiptoed through the sleeping apartment to retrieve it and climbed back into bed the dead man staring at her from the front page
the face was younger the short beard darker but it was he all right
sam westing found dead  found
no one else knew about the beddeddown corpse except doug and he had not believed her
then who found the body
the whisperer
samuel w westing the mysterious industrialist who disappeared thirteen years ago was found dead in his westingtown mansion last night
he was sixtyfive years old
the only child of immigrant parents orphaned at the age of twelve selfeducated hardworking samuel westing saved his laborers wages and bought a small paper mill
from these meager beginnings he built the giant westing paper products corporation and founded the city of westingtown to house his thousands of workers and their families
his estate is estimated to be worth over two hundred million dollars
turtle read that again two hundred million dollars
wow
when asked the secret of his success the industrialist always replied clean living hard work and fair play westing set his own example he neither drank nor smoked and never gambled
yet he was a dedicated gamesman and a master at chess
turtle had been in the game room
thats where she picked up the billiard cue she had carried up the stairs as a weapon
a great patriot samuel westing was famous for his funfilled fourth of july celebrations
whether disguised as ben franklin or a lowly drummer boy he always acted a role in the elaborately staged pageants which he wrote and directed
perhaps best remembered was his surprise portrayal of betsy ross
games and feasting followed the pageant and at sunset mr westing put on his uncle sam costume and set off fireworks from his front lawn
the spectacular pyrotechnic display could be viewed thirty miles away
fireworks
so thats what was in those boxes stamped dangerexplosives stacked in the ground floor storeroom
what a pyrotechnic display that would make if they all went off at the same time
the paper kings later years were marred by tragedy
his only daughter violet drowned on the eve of her wedding and two years later his troubled wife deserted their home
although mr westing obtained a divorce he never remarried
five years later he was sued by an inventor over rights to the disposable paper diaper
on his way to court samuel westing and his friend dr sidney sikes were involved in a nearfatal automobile accident
both men were hospitalized with severe injuries
sikes resumed his westingtown medical practice and the post of county coroner but westing disappeared from sight
it was rumored but never confirmed that he controlled the vast westing paper products corporation from a private island in the south seas
he is still listed as chairman of the board
we are surprised as you are and deeply saddened a spokesman for julian r eastman president and chief executive officer of the corporation stated when informed that westings body was found in his lakeside home
dr sikes response was a tragic end to a tragic life
sam westing was a truly great and important man the funeral will be private
the executor of the westing estate said the deceased requested that in place of flowers donations be sent to blind bowlers of america
turtle turned the page of the newspaper but that was all
that was all
there was no mention of how the body was found
there was no mention of the envelope propped on the bedside table on which a shaky hand had scrawled if i am found dead in bed
she had been edging her way against the fourposter reading the words in the beam of the flashlight when she felt the hand the waxy dead hand that lay on the red white and blue quilt
through her scream she had seen the whitebearded face
she remembered running tripping over the billiard cue falling down the stairs denting sandys flask and dropping everything else
there was no mention of two suspicious peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on the premises or a flashlight or a silver cross on a chain
there was no mention of prowlers no mention of anyone having seen a witch no mention of footprints on the lawn track shoes and sneakers size six
oh well she had nothing to fear other than losing her mothers cross
old mr westing probably died of a heart attackor pneumoniait was drafty in there
turtle hid the folded newspaper in her desk drawer counted her blackandblue marks seven dressed and set out to find the four people who knew she had been in the westing house last night doug hoo theo theodorakis otis amber and sandy
they owed her twentyfour dollars
at noon the sixtytwoyearold delivery boy began his rounds
he had sixteen letters to deliver from e j
plum attorneyat  law
otis amber knew what the letters said because one was addressed to him as a named beneficiary in the estate of samuel w westing your attendance is required in the south library of the westing house tomorrow at 4 pm for the reading of the will
means old man westing left you some money he explained
just sign this receipt here
what do you mean what does position mean
it means position like a job
most receipts have that to make sure the right person gets the right letter grace windsor wexler wrote housewife crossed it out wrote decorator crossed it out and wrote heiress
then she wanted to know who else
how many
how much i aint allowed to say nothing the other heirs were too stunned by the unexpected legacy to bother him with questions
madame hoo marked an x and her husband filled in her name and position
theo wanted to sign the receipt for his brother but chris insisted on doing it himself
slowly taking great pains he wrote christos theodorakis birdwatcher
by the time the sun had set behind the sunset towers parking lot otis amber deliverer had completed his rounds
5  sixteen heirs  the marbled sky lay heavy on the gray great lake when grace windsor wexler parked her car in the westing driveway and strode up the walk ahead of her daughters
her husband had refused to come but no matter
recalling family gossip about a rich uncle maybe it was a greatuncleanyway his name was sam grace had convinced herself that she was the rightful heir
jake was jewish so he could not possibly be related to sam westing
i cant imagine what became of my silver cross she said fingering the goldlink necklace under her mink stole as she paused to appraise the big house
you know angela we could have the wedding right here…turtle where are you wandering off to now the letter said never mind turtle preferred not to explain how she knew the library could be entered from the french doors on the lawn
the front door was opened by crow
although the sunset towers cleaning woman always wore black here it reminded grace wexler to dab at her eyes with a lace handkerchief
this was a house of mourning
the silent crow helped angela with her coat and nodded approval of her blue velvet dress with white collar and cuffs
ill keep my furs with me grace said
she did not want to be taken for one of the poor relatives
seems rather chilly in here turtle too complained of the chill but her mother tugged off her coat to reveal a fluffy ruffly pink party dress two sizes  too large and four inches too long
it was one of angelas handmedowns
please sit anywhere the lawyer said without glancing from the envelopes he was sorting at the head of the long library table
mrs wexler took the chair to his right and motioned to her favorite
angela sat down next to her mother removed a trousseau towel from her large tapestry shoulder bag and took up embroidering the monogram d slumped in the third chair turtle pretended she had never seen this paneled library with its bare and dusty shelves
suddenly she sat up with a start
an open coffin draped in bunting rested on a raised platform at the far corner of the room in it lay the dead man looking exactly as she had found him except now he was dressed in the costume of uncle samincluding the tall hat
between the waxy hands folded across his chest lay her mothers silver cross
grace wexler was too busy greeting the next heir to notice
why doctor d i had no idea youd be here but of course youll soon be a member of the family
come sit next to your bridetobe turtle youll have to move down d denton deere always in a hurry brushed a quick kiss on angelas cheek
he was still wearing his hospital whites
i didnt know this was a pajama party turtle said relinquishing her chair and stomping to the far end of the table
the next heir short and round entered timidly her lips pressed together in an impish smile that curved up to what must be pointed ears under her straightcut steely hair
hello mrs baumbach angela said
i dont think youve met my fiancé denton deere youre a lucky man mr deere doctor deere mrs wexler corrected her puzzled by the dressmakers presence
yes of course im so sorry sensing that she was unwelcome at this end of the room flora baumbach walked on
hi mind if i sit next to you
i promise not to pull your braid thats okay turtle was hunched over the table her small chin resting between her crossed arms
from there she could see everything except the coffin
grace wexler dismissed the next heir with an audible tongue click
that distasteful little man didnt even have the sense to remove his silly aviators cap
tsk and what in heavens name was he doing here
the delivery boy shouted lets give a cheer otis amber is here turtle laughed flora baumbach tittered and grace wexler again clicked her tongue tsk doug hoo and his father entered silently but sandy gave a hearty hi and a cheery wave
he wore his doormans uniform but unlike otis amber carried his hat in his hand
grace windsor wexler was no longer surprised at the odd assortment of heirs
household workers all or former employees she decided
the rich always reward servants in their wills and her uncle sam was a generous man
arent your parents coming she asked the older theodorakis boy as he wheeled his brother into the library
they werent invited theo replied
itsssoonn chris announced
what did he say he said its snowing theo and flora baumbach explained at the same time
the heirs watched helplessly as the invalids thin frame was suddenly torn and twisted by convulsions
only the dressmaker rushed to his side
i know i know she simpered you were trying to tell us about the itsybitsy snowflings theo moved her away
my brother is not an infant and hes not retarded so please no more baby talk blinking away tears flora baumbach returned to her seat the elfin smile still painted on her pained face
some stared at the afflicted child with morbid fascination but most turned away
they didnt want to see
pyramidal tract involvement denton deere whispered trying to impress angela with his diagnosis
angela her face a mirror to the boys suffering grabbed her tapestry bag and hurried out of the room
why hello judge ford proud of her liberalism grace windsor wexler stood and leaned over the table to shake the black womans hand
she must be here in some legal capacity or maybe her mother was a household maid but of one thing grace was certain j j ford could no more be related to samuel w westing than mr hoo
cant we get started mr hoo asked hoping to get back in time to watch the football game on television
i must return to my restaurant he announced loudly
sunday is our busy day but we are still accepting reservations
shin hoos restaurant on the fifth floor of sunset towers specializing in…  doug tugged at his fathers sleeve
not here dad not in front of the dead what dead mr hoo had not noticed the open coffin
now he did
ohhh the lawyer explained that several heirs had not yet arrived
my wife is not coming said mr hoo
grace said dr
wexler was called away on an emergency operation an emergency packers game in green bay turtle confided to flora baumbach who scrunched up her shoulders and tittered behind a plump hand
then we are still waiting for one no two more the lawyer said fumbling with his papers his hands shaking under the strict scrutiny of the judge
judge ford had recognized e j
plum
several months ago he had argued before her court bumbling to the point of incompetence
why she wondered was a young inexperienced attorney chosen to handle an estate of such importance
come to think of it what was she doing here
curiosity
perhaps but what about the rest of them the other tenants of sunset towers
dont anticipate josiejo wait for sam westing to make the first move
light footsteps were heard in the hall
it was only angela who blushed and hugging her tapestry bag close to her body returned to her seat
the heirs waited
some chatted with neighbors some looked up at the gilt ceiling some studied the pattern of the oriental rug
judge ford stared at the table at theo theodorakis hand
a calloused hand a healed cut the shiny slash of a burn on the deep bronze skin
she lowered her hands to her lap
his greek skin was darker than her black skin
thump thump thump
someone was coming or were there two of them
in came crow
eyes lowered without a word she sat down next to otis amber
a dark cloud passed from her face as she eased off a tight shoe under the table
thump thump thump
the last expected heir arrived
hello everybody
sorry im late
i havent quite adjusted to thissydelle pulaski waved a gaily painted crutch in the air tottered and set it down quickly with another thumpthis crutch
crutch
what a horrible word but i guess ill have to get used to it she pursed her bright red mouth painted to a fullness beyond the narrow line of her lips trying to suppress a smile of triumph
everyone was staring she knew they would notice
what happened pulaski otis amber asked
did you pull turtles braid again more likely she visited wexler the foot butcher sandy suggested
sydelle was pleased to hear someone come to her defense with a loud click of the tongue
she had not even blinked a false eyelash at those offensive remarks poise they call it
its really nothing she reported bravely just some sort of wasting disease
but pity me not i shall live out my remaining time enjoying each precious day to the full thump thump thump
the secretary kept to the side of the room avoiding the oriental rug that might cushion the thump of her purplestriped crutch as she made her way to the end of the table
her  exaggerated hips were even more exaggerated by the wavy stripes of white on her purple dress
purple waves turtle thought
denton deere almost fell off his chair leaning back to follow this most unusual case
first she favored her left leg then her right leg
what is it whispered mrs wexler
the intern did not have the least notion but he had to say something
traveling sporadic myositis he pronounced quickly and glanced at angela
her eyes remained on her embroidery
the lawyer stood documents in hand and cleared his throat several times
grace windsor wexler her chin tilted in the regal pose of an heiress gave him her full attention
one minute please sydelle pulaski propped her purpleandwhitestriped crutch against the table then removed a shorthand pad and pencil from her handbag
thank you for waiting you may begin  6  the westing will  my name the young lawyer began is edgar jennings plum
although i never had the honor of meeting samuel w westing for some reason yet unexplained i was appointed executor of this will found adjacent to the body of the deceased
let me assure you that i have examined the documents at hand as thoroughly as possible in the short time available
i have verified the signatures to be those of samuel w westing and his two witnesses julian r eastman president and chief executive officer of westing paper products corporation and sidney sikes md coroner of westing county
although the will you are about to hear may seem eccentric i pledge my good name and reputation on its legality breathless with suspense the heirs stared popeyed at edgar jennings plum who now coughed into his fist now cleared his throat now rustled papers and now at last began to read aloud from the westing will
i samuel w westing resident of westing county in the fair state of wisconsin in the great and glorious united states of america being of sound mind and memory do hereby declare this to be my last will and testament
first  i returned to live among my friends and my enemies
i came home to seek my heir aware that in doing so i faced death
and so i did
today i have gathered together my nearest and dearest my sixteen nieces and nephews what  sit down grace windsor wexler
the lawyer stammered an apology to the stillstanding woman
i was only reading i mean those are mr westings words if its any comfort to you mrs wexler judge ford remarked with biting dignity i am just as appalled by our purported relationship oh i didnt mean… hey angela turtle called the length of the table
its against the law to marry that doctortobe
hes your cousin d denton deere patting angelas hand in his best bedside manner pricked his finger on her embroidery needle
i cant tell who said what with this chatter sydelle pulaski complained
would you read that again mr lawyer today i have gathered together my nearest and dearest my sixteen nieces and nephews sit down grace windsor wexler
to view the body of your uncle sam for the last time
tomorrow its ashes will be scattered to the four winds
second  i samuel w westing hereby swear that i did not die of natural causes
my life was taken from meby one of you
ooouggg chriss arm flailed the air his accusing finger pointed here no there it pointed everywhere
his exaggerated motions acted out the confusion shared by all but one of the heirs as they looked around at the stunned faces of their neighbors to confirm what they heard
rereading her notes sydelle pulaski now uttered a small shriek
eek murder
does that mean westing was murdered sandy asked the heir on his left
crow turned away in silence
does that mean murder he asked the heir on his right
murder
of course it means murder
sam westing was murdered mr hoo replied
either that or he ate once too often in that greasyspoon coffee shop theo resented hoos slur on the family business
it was murder all right
and the will says the murderer is one of us he glared at the restaurant owner
have the police been notified of the charge judge ford asked the lawyer
plum shrugged
i presume they will perform an autopsy the judge shook her head in dismay
autopsy
westing was already embalmed tomorrow he would be cremated
the police are helpless
the culprit is far too cunning to be apprehended for this dastardly deed
oh my flora baumbach clapped a hand to her mouth on hearing dastardly first murder now a swear word
i alone know the name
now it is up to you
cast out the sinner let the guilty rise and confess
amen said crow
third who among you is worthy to be the westing heir
help me
my soul shall roam restlessly until that one is found
the estate is at the crossroads
the heir who wins the windfall will be the one who finds the… ashes the doorman shouted
some tittered to relieve the unbearable tension some cast him a reproachful glance grace wexler clicked her tongue and sydelle pulaski shhhed
it was just a joke sandy tried to explain
you know ashes scattered to the winds so the one who wins the windfall gets oh never mind fourth  hail to thee o land of opportunity
you have made me the son of poor immigrants rich powerful and respected
so take stock in america my heirs and sing in praise of this generous land
you too may strike it rich who dares to play the westing game
game
what game turtle wanted to know
no matter judge ford said rising to leave
this is either a cruel trick or the man was insane
fifth  sit down your honor and read the letter this brilliant young attorney will now hand over to you
it was uncanny
several heads turned towards the coffin but westings eyes were shut forever
the brilliant young attorney fumbled through a stack of papers felt his pockets and finally found the letter in his briefcase
arent you going to open it theo asked as the judge resumed her seat and put the sealed envelope in her purse
no need
sam westing could afford to buy a dozen certificates of sanity the poor are crazy the rich just eccentric mr hoo said bitterly
are you implying sir that the medical profession is corrupt denton deere challenged
shhh sixth before you proceed to the game room there will be one minute of silent prayer for your good old uncle sam
flora baumbach was the only heir to cry
crow was the only one to pray
by the time sydelle pulaski could assume a pose of reverence the minute was up
7   the westing game  eight card tables each with two chairs were arranged in the center of the game room
sports equipment lined the walls
hunting rifles pingpong paddles billiard cues a full rack turtle noticed bows and arrows darts bats racquetsall looked like possible murder weapons to the jittery heirs who were waiting to be told where to sit
theo wandered over to the chess table to admire the finely carved pieces
someone had moved a white pawn
okay hell play along
theo defended the opening with a black knight
on hearing plums throatclearing signal sydelle pulaski switched the painted crutch to her left armpit and flipped to a fresh page in her notebook
shhh seventh  and now dear friends relatives and enemies the westing game begins
the rules are simple  number of players 16 divided into 8 pairs
 each pair will receive 10000
 each pair will receive one set of clues
 forfeits if any player drops out the partner must leave the game
the pair must return the money
absent pairs forfeit the  10000 their clues will be held until the next session
 players will be given two days notice of the next session
each pair may then give one answer
 object of the game to win
did you hear that crow otis amber said excitedly
ten thousand dollars
now arent you glad i made you come huh shhh that was turtle
the object of the game was to win and she wanted to win
eighth  the heirs will now be paired
when called go to the assigned table
your name and position will be read as signed on the receipt
it will be up to the other players to discover who you really are
1   madame sun lin hoo cook jake wexler standing or sitting  when not lying down grace wexler did not understand her husbands joke about position
mr hoo did but he was in no mood for humor ten thousand dollars was at stake
both pleaded for their absent spousesemergency operation my wife doesnt even  speak englishto no avail
table one remained empty and moneyless
2  turtle wexler witch flora baumbach dressmaker  sighs of relief greeted the naming of turtles partner but flora baumbach seemed pleased to be paired with the kicking witch
at least her face was still puckered in that elfin grin
turtle had hoped for one of the highschool seniors especially doug hoo
3  christos theodorakis bird  watcher d denton deere intern st  josephs hospital department of plastic surgery theo protested he and his brother should be paired together chris was his responsibility
mrs wexler protested doctor d should be paired with his bridetobe
d denton deere protested but silently if this had been arranged for free medical advice they whoever they are were mistaken
he was a busy man
he was a doctor not a nursemaid
but chris was delighted to be part of the outside world
he would tell the intern about the person who limped into the westing house maybe that was the murdererunless his partner was the murderer
this was really exciting even better than television
4   alexander mcsouthers  doorman j j ford judge appellate division  of the state supreme court the heirs watched the jaunty doorman pull out a chair for the judge
it had never occurred to them that sandy was a nickname for alexander but that couldnt be what sam westing meant by it will be up to the other players to discover who you really are
or could it
the judge did not return the chiptoothed smile
doorman he calls himself and the others had signed simple things too cook dressmaker
the podiatrist had even made fun of his position she must seem as pompous as that intern putting on airs with that title
well she had worked hard to get where she was why shouldnt she be proud of it
she was no token her record was faultless…watch it josiejo
westings getting to you already and the game has barely begun
5   grace windsor wexler heiress james shin hoo restaurateur  grace windsor wexler ignored the snickers
if she was not the heiress now she would be soon what with her clues angelas clues turtles clues dentons clues and the clues of mr hoos obedient son
five thousand dollars lost
oh well who needs jake anyway
shed win on her own
youll be happy  to know that mr westing was really my uncle sam she whispered to her partner
so what thought mr hoo
five thousand dollars lost
he should have told his wife about this meeting dragged her along
sam westing the louse has cheated him again
whoever killed him deserves a medal
6   berthe erica crow good  salvation soup kitchen otis amber deliverer  the delivery boy danced a merry jig but crow her sore foot squeezed back into her tight shoe headed for table six with a grim face
why were they watching her
did they think she killed windy
could the guilty know her guilt
repent
crow limps chris theodorakis noted
7   theo theodorakis brother doug hoo first in allstate high  school mile run they slapped hands and doug jogged to table seven
theo moved more slowly
passing the chessboard he saw that white had made a second move
he countered with a black pawn
maybe he should not have written brother but like it or not that was his position in life
chris was smiling at him in pure sweetness which made theo feel even guiltier about his resentment
i guess that makes us partners ms pulaski angela said
pardon me did you say something 8   sydelle pulaski secretary to the  president angela wexler none  angela stepped tentatively behind the secretary not knowing whether to ignore her disability or to take her arm
at least her crippled partner could not be the murderer but it was embarrassing being paired with such a…no she shouldnt feel that way
it was her mother who was upset she could feel the indignant anger without having to look at grace her perfect daughter was paired with a freak
what good luck the hobbling sydelle pulaski thought
now she would really be noticed with such a pretty young thing for a partner
they might even invite her to the wedding
shed paint a crutch white with little pink nosegays
denton deere was troubled
what in the world did angela mean by nun
once again edgar jennings plum cleared his throat
nasal drip denton deere whispered confiding the latest diagnosis to his partner
chris giggled
whats the crippled kid so happy about the intern wondered
ninth money
each pair in attendance will now receive a check for the sum of  10000
the check cannot be cashed without the signatures of both partners
spend it wisely or go for broke
may god thy gold refine
a piercing shriek suddenly reminded the westing heirs of murder
while passing out the checks the lawyer had stepped on crows sore foot
is this legal judge sandy asked
it is not only legal mr mcsouthers judge ford replied signing her name to the check and handing it to the doorman it is a shrewd way to keep everyone playing the game tenth  each pair in attendance will now receive an envelope containing a set of clues
no two sets of clues are alike
it is not what you have its what you dont have that counts
placing the last of the envelopes on table eight the young lawyer smiled at angela
sydelle pulaski smiled back
this makes no sense denton deere complained
four clues typed on cut squares of westing superstrength paper towels lay on the table before him
arms and elbows at odds with fingers fanned chris tried to rearrange the words in some grammatical if not logical order
hey watch it the intern shouted as one clue wafted to the floor
flora baumbach leaped from her chair at the next table picked up the square of paper and set it face down before the trembling youngster
i didnt see it she announced loudly
i really didnt see it she repeated under the questioning gaze of her partner turtle wexler witch
the word she had seen was plain
the players protected their clues more carefully now
hunched over the tables they moved the paper squares this way and that way mumbling and grumbling
the murderers name must be there somewhere
only one pair had not yet seen their clues
at table eight sydelle pulaski placed one hand on the envelope raised a finger to her lips and tilted her head toward the other heirs
just watch and listen she meant
she may be odd but shes smart angela thought
since each pair had a different set of clues they would watch and listen for clues to their clues
hehehe the delivery boy slapped his partner on the back
thats us old pal queen crow and king amber whats this on or no doug hoo turned a clue upside down then right side up again
theo jabbed an elbow in his ribs and turned to see if anyone had heard
angela lowered her eyes in time
j j ford crumpled the clues in her fist and rose in anger
im sorry mr mcsouthers
playing a pawn in this foolish game is one thing but to be insulted with minstrel show dialect…  please judge please dont quit on me sandy pleaded
id have to give back all that money it would break my wifes heart
and my poor kids… judge ford regarded the desperate doorman without pity
so many had begged before her bench
please judge
i lost my job my pension
i cant fight no more
dont quit just because of some nonsensical words sticks and stones can break my bones but words will never hurt me she had chanted as a child
words did hurt but she was no longer a child
nor a hanging judge
and there was always the chance…all right mr mcsouthers
ill stay j j ford sat down her eyes sparking with wickedness
and well play the game just as sam westing would have played it
mean flora baumbach squeezed her eyes together and screwed up her face
she was concentrating
havent you memorized them yet turtle didnt like the way otis ambers scrawny neck was swiveling high out of his collar
and what was angela staring at
yes i think so the dressmaker replied but i cant make heads or tails of them they make perfect sense to me turtle said
one by one she put the clues in her mouth chewed and swallowed them
jibberish mr hoo muttered
grace windsor wexler agreed
excuse me mr
plum but what are these clues clues to
i mean exactly what are we supposed to find purple waves sandy joked with a wink at turtle
mrs wexler uttered a cry of recognition and changed the order of two of her clues
its still jibberish mr hoo complained
other players pressed the lawyer for more information
ed plum only shrugged
then could you please give us copies of the will a copy will be on file… judge ford began
im afraid not your honor the lawyer said
the will not i mean the will will will… he paused and tried again
the will will not be filed until the first of the year
my instructions specifically state that no heir is allowed to see any of the documents until the game is over no copy
thats not fair
but wait they did have a copy
a shorthand copy
sydelle pulaski had plenty of attention now
she smiled back at the friendly faces revealing a lipstick stain on her front teeth
isnt there some sort of a last statement sandy asked plum
i mean like the intern says nothing makes any sense eleventh  senseless you say
death is senseless yet makes way for the living
life too is senseless unless you know who you are what you want and which way the wind blows
so on with the game
the solution is simple if you know whom you are looking for
but heirs beware
be aware
some are not who they say they are and some are not who they seem to be
whoever you are its time to go home
god bless you all and remember this buy westing paper products
8   the paired heirs  during the night flora baumbachs itsybitsy snowflings raged into a blizzard
the tenants of sunset towers awoke from cluechasing blooddripping dreams bound in twisted sheets and imprisoned by fifteenfoot snowdrifts
no telephones
no electricity
snowbound with a murderer
the slow procession looked like some ancient mysterious rite as partner sought out partner on the windowless stairs and silent pairs threaded through the corridors in the flickering light of crooked colorstriped candles the product of turtles stint at summer camp
these handmade candles are both practical and romantic she said peddling her wares from apartment door to apartment door to frightened tenants at seven in the morning
oh its only turtle
and the colored stripes tell time which is very handy if your electric clock stopped
each stripe burns exactly onehalf hour more or less
twelve stripes six hours how much  not wishing to take advantage of this emergency ive reduced the price to only five dollars each outrageous
even more so when the electricity came on two hours after her last sale
sorry no refunds turtle said
no matter
what was five dollars to heirs of an estate worth two hundred million
clues they had to work on those clues
behind closed doors
whisper someone may be listening
not all the heirs were huddled in plotting puzzlesolving pairs
jake wexler had retreated to his office after a long and loud argument with his wife
he sure could have used half of that ten thousand dollars but he wouldnt admit it not to her
the forfeited money upset her more than the murder of her uncle if he was her uncle
five floors above jakes partner stood before the restaurants front window staring at the froth on the angry lake and beyond
no one had bothered to tell madame hoo about the westing game
other players were snowbound elsewhere denton deere in the hospital sandy at home
no one gave a thought to where otis amber or crow might be
but sydelle pulaski was there thumping her crutch against the baseboards as she limped through the carpeted halls on the arm of her pretty partner
not one but seven tenants had invited her to morning coffee or afternoon tea murderer or not they had to see pulaskis copy of that will
three lumps please
angela drinks it black your health
thank the lord im still able to hobble about your job
i was private secretary to the president of schultz sausages
poor mr schultz i dont know how hell manage  without me your shorthand notes
thank you for the refreshments
i must hurry back for my medication
come angela one heir had not invited them in but that didnt stop sydelle pulaski from barging into apartment 2d
hi chris
just thought wed pop in to see how youre doing
dont be scared
im not the murderer angela is not the murderer and we dont think you are the murderer
mind if i sit down the secretary toppled into a chair next to the invalid before he could reply
here i stole a macaroon for you
its so sticky youll be tasting it all day i must have six strands of coconut between my upper molars chris took the cookie
just look at that smile it could break your heart angela wished her partner had not said that it seemed so insensitive so crude
but at least sydelle was talking to him which was more than she was able to do
angela the fortunate one standing like a dummy
um i know denton wants to work on the clues with you
hes snowbound too you verr preddy how did pretty come out
he meant to say nice chris bent his curly head over the geography book in his lap
she wasnt laughing at him
it was all right to ask her because she was going to marry his partner
wha arr ggraannz angela did not understand
chris fanned the pages of the book to a picture of a wheat field
ggraannz oh grains
you want to know the names of some grains
lets see theres wheat rye corn barley oats  oohss angela thought the boy was going into a fit but he was only repeating her last word oats
sydelle was puffing her warm breath on the window and wiping a frosted area clean with her sleeve
there now youll be able to watch the birds again
anything else we can do for you young man chris nodded
read mme shorthan nnoos the pretty lady and the funny lady moved quickly out the door
one limped but it was a pretended limp he could tell not like the limper on the westing house lawn
oats
chris closed his eyes to picture the clues for  plain  grain  shed  grain  oats  otis amber
for  d from shed  ford
but neither the delivery boy nor the judge limped and he still hadnt figured out she or plain
hed have to wait for denton deere denton deere was smart he was a doctor
chris raised his binoculars to the cliff
windblown drifts buttressed the housesomething moved on the second floor a hand holding back the edge of a drape
slowly the heavy drape fell back against the window
the westing house was snowbound too and somebody was snowbound in it
only one of the players thought the clues told how the ten thousanddollar check was to be spent
take stock in america the will said
go for broke the will said
in the stock market turtle said
and whoever makes the most money wins it all the whole two hundred million dollars their clues  sea  mountain  am  o  stood for symbols of three corporations listed on the stock exchange sea mt the abbreviation for mountain amo
but am and o are separate clues flora baumbach said
to confuse us but what about the murderer
i thought we were supposed to find the name of the murderer to put us off the track if the police suspected murder shed be in jail by now
her fingerprints were all over everything in the westing house including the corpse
you dont really think one of us could have killed a living breathing human being in cold blood do you mrs baumbach
do you turtle did but the dressmaker was a cream puff
dont you look at me like that turtle wexler
you know very well i could never think such a thing
i must have misunderstood
oh my i just wish miss pulaski had shown us her copy of the will turtle returned to her calculations multiplying numbers of shares times price adding a brokers commission trying to total the sums to the ten thousand dollars they had to spend
flora baumbach may have been wrong about the murder but she was not convinced of turtles plan
what about buy westing paper products
im sure that was in the will great turtle exclaimed
well do just that well add wpp to the list of stocks were going to buy flora baumbach had watched enough television commercials to know that buy westing paper products meant that as soon as she could get to market shed buy all the  westing products on the shelf
still it felt good having a child around again
shed play along gladly
you know turtle you may be right about putting our money in the stock market
i remember the will said may god thy gold refine
that must be from the bible shakespeare turtle replied
all quotations were either from the bible or shakespeare
mr hoo moved aside a full ashtray with a show of distaste and rearranged the clues
purple fruited makes more sense grace wexler looked across the restaurant to the lone figure at the window
are you sure your wife doesnt understand english i mean after living here so long thats my second wife
she came over from hong kong two years ago she does look young but its so hard to tell ages of people of the oriental persuasion grace said
why was he glaring at her like that
your wife is quite lovely you know so dolllike and inscrutable hoo bit off half a chocolate bar
he had enough problems with the empty restaurant a lazy son and his nagging ulcer now he has to put up with this bigot
grace lit another cigarette and rearranged the clues to read purple waves
you heard that doorman say purple waves it must mean something
and that ghastly secretary was wearing a dress with purple waves last night not to mention her crutch you should not speak unkindly of those less fortunate than you hoo said
youre quite right grace replied
i thought the poor thing handled her infirmity with great couragetraveling mimosa my future soninlaw says hes a doctor you know
anyhow pulaski couldnt possibly be the murderer not the way she gimps around
besides how could my uncle sam know shed wear purple waves to his funeral hoo waved the cigarette smoke from his face
the murderer had to have a motive
how about this a niece murders her rich uncle to inherit his money good sport that she was grace tossed back her head and uttered an amused hahaha not that i care hoo said
that cheating moneybags got what he deserved
whats the matter look grace pointed to the clues
fruited  purple  waves  for  sea  for sea
the murderer lives in apartment 4c i live in 4c hoo barked
if sam westing wanted to say 4c he would have written number 4 letter c sea means sea like what a turtle swims in come now mr hoo we are both being silly
have you spoken to your son about his clues some son
if you can catch him you can ask him hoo stuffed the rest of the candy bar in his mouth
and some business ive got here
everybody orders up nobody orders down
that coffee shop is sending me to the poorhouse
and your angela and that pulaski woman they didnt show us the will they didnt give us their clues they didnt pay for three  cups of jasmine tea and six almond cookies and you smoke too much and you eat too much grace threw her coin purse on the table and stormed out of the restaurant
change thats all hell get from her hed have to beg on his knees before shed sign grace windsor wexler on the tenthousanddollar check that madman
some pair they made attila the hun and gracie the useless
gracie windkloppel wexler heir pretender pretentious heir
first the money
they signed their names to the check half would go into doug hoos savings account half would go to theos parents
next the clues his  n  on  to  thee  for  maybe theyre numbers one two three four theo guessed
i still say on is no the bored track star said
he clasped his hands behind his head leaned back in the coffee shop booth and stretched his long legs under the opposite bench
and no is what we got no real clues no leads no will after three cups of coffee two pastries and a bowl of rice pudding with cream sydelle pulaski had offered nothing in return
theo refused to give up
are you sure you didnt see anything unusual at the westing house that night i didnt kill westing if thats what you mean and the only unusual thing i saw was turtle wexler
i think the pest is madly in love with me hows that for luck  get serious doug
one of the heirs is a murderer we could all get killed just because somebody zapped the old man doesnt mean hes going to kill again
dad says… doug paused
his fathers comment about awarding a medal to the murderer might be incriminating
theo tried another tack
i was playing chess with somebody in the game room last night who thats whats strange i dont know who
well have to find out which one of the heirs plays chess since when is chessplaying evidence for murder well its something to go on theo replied
and another thing the will said no two sets of clues are alike
maybe all the clues put together make one message a message that points to the murderer
somehow or other well have to get the heirs to pool the clues oh sure
the killer cant wait to hand over the clues that will hang him doug rose
snowbound or not he had to stay in shape for the track meet
for the rest of the day he jogged through the hallways and up and down stairs scaring the nervous tenants half out of their wits
judge j j ford had no doubt that the clues she shared with the doorman were meant for her but sam westing could toss off sharper results than skies  am  shining  brother  his choice of words must have been limited therefore these clues were part of a longer statement
a statement that named a name
the name of the murderer
no
westing could not have been murdered
if his life had been threatened if he had been in danger of any kind he would have insisted on police protection
he owned the police he owned the whole town
sam westing was not the type to let himself get killed
not unless he was insane
the judge opened the envelope given her by the incompetent plum
a certificate of sanity dated last week having thoroughly examined…keen mind and memory… excellent physical condition…signed sidney sikes md sikes
that sounded familiar
the judge scanned the obituary she had cut from saturdays newspaper
…samuel westing and his friend dr sidney sikes were involved in a nearfatal automobile accident
both men were hospitalized with severe injuries
sikes resumed his westingtown medical practice and the post of county coroner but westing disappeared from sight
sikes was westings friend and she remembered a witness to the will but he was also a physician in good standing
she would accept his opinion on westings sanity for the time being at least
back to the clues
look at her the bigtime judge fussing over scraps of westing superstrength paper towels
forget  the clues she said aloud rising from her desk to putter about the room
nibbling on a macaroon she stacked the used coffee cups on a tray
if only that pulaski person had let her study the will
thats where the real clues were buried among the veiled threats and pompous promises the slogans and stillness in that hodgepodge of a will
in his will sam westing implied he did not state he implied that 1 he was murdered 2 the murderer was one of the heirs 3 he alone knew the name of the murderer and 4 the name of the murderer was the answer to the game
the game a tricky divisive westing game
no matter how much fear and suspicion he instilled in the players sam westing knew that greed would keep them playing the game
until the murderer was captured
and punished
sam westing was not murdered but one of his heirs was guiltyguilty of some offense against a relentless man
and that heir was in danger
from his grave westing would stalk his enemy and through his heirs he would wreak his revenge
which one
which heir was the target of westings vindictiveness
in the name of justice she would have to find westings victim before the others did
she would have to learn everything she could about each one of the heirs
who are they and how did their lives touch westings these sixteen strangers whose only connection with one another was sunset towers
sunset towersshed start from there
good the telephones were working again
the number she dialed was answered on the first ring
hi there this is a recording of yours truly barney northrup
im at your servicesoon as i get back in my office that is
just sing out  your problem to old barney here when you hear the beep beep
j j ford hung up without singing out her problem to old barney
he too could be involved in westings plot
the newspaper she would try the newspaper surely someone was snowbound there
after eight rings a live voice answered
we usually dont supply that kind of information over the phone but since its you judge ford ill be happy to oblige
just spell out the names and ill call back if i find anything thank you id appreciate that it was a beginning
sam westing was dead but maybe just once she could beat him at his own game
his last game
having found what she wanted in turtles desk angela returned to her frilly bedroom where sydelle pulaski glasses low on her nose was perched on a ruffled stool at the vanity table smearing blue shadow on her eyelids
first we tackle our own clues the secretary said frowning at the result in the threefold mirror
unlucky from the day she was born she now had a beautiful and wellloved partner
there was always the chance that they alone had been given the answer
she unsealed the envelope and held it out to angela
take one angela removed the first clue good
now it was sydelles turn
glory be she exclaimed thinking she had the name of the murderer
her thumb was covering the letter d the word was hood
angelas turn
the third clue was from
sydelles turn
the fourth clue was spacious
the fifth and last clue was angela uttered a low moan
her hand shook as she passed the paper to her partner
the fifth and last clue was grace
grace thats your mothers name isnt it sydelle said
well dont worry that clue doesnt mean your mother is the murderer
the will says it is not what you have its what you dont have that counts the secretary had not yet transcribed the shorthand but she had read it through several times before hiding the notebook in a safe place
by the way are you really related to mr westing angela shrugged
sydelle assumed that meant no and turned to the clues
good  grace  from  hood  spacious  the only thing i can figure from these clues is good gracious from hood space
as soon as the parking lot is shoveled out well peek under the hoods of all the cars
a map or more clues may be hidden there
maybe even the murder weapon
now lets hear about the other clues angela reported on the clues gathered in the game room and during the days comings and goings king queen
otis amber said king otis and queen crow purple waves
mother switched two clues around when sandy mentioned those words
on or no
doug and theo could not decide whether that clue was right side up or upside down
grains
chris theodorakis thinks that clue refers to otis amber
you know grainsoats
mt angela showed her partner the crumpled scrap of paper she had picked up along with sydelles dropped crutch during flora baumbachs tea party
500 shares mt at 6 brokers commission     3000 90 3090  i checked turtles diary
she is not following any stock with a symbol like mt so it must be one of her clues
mt could stand for either mountain or empty excellent sydelle pulaski remarked
her partner was beautiful but not dumb
read all the clues together now good hood from spacious grace king queen purple waves onno grains mountainempty  sydelle was disappointed
it is not what you have its what you dont have that counts
and what we dont have is a verb
nothing makes sense without a verb
what about the judge judge ford thought her clues were an insult and she said something about playing a pawn in westings game
and she had a clipping of the obituary on her desk
this obituary angela handed sydelle the newspaper taken from turtles drawer
whats that it was a knock on the front door
it was footsteps in the living room
it was theo
anyone for a game of chess he asked leaning through the bedroom doorway
no thank you sydelle replied looking very busy
theo smiled shyly at angela and left
sydelle read the obituary in turtles newspaper
the words two hundred million dollars were underlined but she found a more interesting item
sam westing was a master at chess no wonder theos so interested
do you know anything about the game angela a little she replied slowly putting the pieces in order
the judge says shes a pawn and otis amber says hes the king crows the queen oh well its probably just a coincidence we cant leave any stone unturned sydelle insisted
as the will says object of the game to win what did you say object of the game to win how about object of the game twin
maybe the murderer is a twin twin sydelle liked that
the only problem would be getting the murderer to admit that he or she is a twin
lets get back to my apartment
its time i transcribed those notes angela helped the invalid to her feet and nervously peered in both directions before stepping into the hallway
sydelle chuckled at her timidity
theres nothing to be scared of angela
westing was murdered for his money and were not rich yet
we wont be rich enough to be murdered until we find the name and by the time we get the money from the estate the murderer will be locked up in jail  in spite of the impeccable logic angela looked back over her shoulder several times on the way to 3c
strange sydelle stood before her open apartment door
she had slammed it shut on leaving but had not locked the dead bolt after all not even a burglar could get into a snowbound building
unless… angela too frightened to notice that sydelle ran through the apartment with her crutch in the air found her partner in the bathroom frantically tossing soiled towels from the hamper
sydelle pulaski stared at the bare wicker bottom then sank to the rim of the bathtub shaking her head in disbelief
someone in sunset towers had stolen the shorthand notebook
9   lost and found  early the next morning a typed index card was tacked to the elevators back wall lost important business papers of no value to anyone but the owner
please return to sydelle pulaski 3c
no questions asked
the shorthand notebook was not returned but the idea of a bulletin board was an instant success
by late afternoon the elevator was papered with notices and filled with tenants  facing sideways and backwards reading as they rode up and down
lost silver cross on filigree chain topaz pin and earrings goldfilled cuff links
return to grace windsor wexler 3d
reward
all players willing to discuss sharing their clues come to the coffee shop tomorrow 10 am  whoever stole my mickey mouse clock better give it back
just leave it in the hall in front of apartment 3d when no ones looking
turtle wexler  order down not up
or come on up to the fifth floor and dine in elegance at shin hoos restaurant specializing in exquisite chinese cuisine
lost string of pearls
sentimental value
if found please bring them to apartment 2c
thank you flora baumbach dressmaking and alterations reasonably priced  found six clues  the following clues printed on squares of westing toilet tissue were found in the third floor hallway braided  kicking  tortoise  si  a  brat  i am having an informal party this evening from eight oclock on
you are all invited
please come
j j ford apartment 4d  turtle wherever you are be home at seventhirty sharp
your loving mother mom im home no one else was
on reading mrs wexlers note in the elevator flora baumbach had insisted you must do what your mother says when turtle replied like showing her our clues flora baumbachs answer was perhaps so
after all she is your mother flora baumbach was sappy
always smiling that dumb smile always so polite to everybody
and so timid
when they had finally reached a snowbound broker flora baumbach was so nervous she dropped the telephone
turtle had to admit to some nervousness herself but it was the first real order she had ever place
for a minute there she thought she might choke on the thumping heart that had jumped into her throat  but she had pulled off the transaction like a pro
now if only the stock market would go up shed show mr westing about refining gold
the next part of the will would read whichsoever pair made the most money with the ten thousand dollars inherits the whole estate she was sure of it
oh there you are grace wexler acted as if turtle was the tardy one but she quickly sweetened
come dear lets go to your room and ill fix your hair her mother sat behind her on the edge of the narrow bed loosed the dark brown hair and brushed it to a gloss
she had not done that with such care in a long long time
have you eaten mrs
baumbach made me a dinner turtle felt the fingers dividing the hair into strands
her mother was so warm so close
your poor fathers probably starving hes been so busy on the phone changing appointments and all daddys eating in the coffee shop i just saw him there turtle had dashed in shouting the braided tortoise strikes again and kicked a surprised theo in the shin
it was doug hoo not theo who had made the sign
her mother twisted the three strands into a braid
i think you should wear your party dress tonight you look so pretty in pink pretty
she had never used that word before not about her
whats going on
you know sweetheart im rather hurt that you wont tell your own mother about your clues so that was it
she should have known
my lips are sealed turtle said defiantly
just one eensybeensy clue grace wheedled winding a rubber band around the end of the braid
nnn turtle replied through sealed lips
angela came into the small room and tugged turtles braid only her sister could get away with that
beaming on her favorite grace took her hand then gasped
angela wheres your engagement ring i have a rash on my finger thump thump
sydelle pulaski appeared in the doorway
hi whats everybody doing in the closet see i told you this is a closet turtle said
grace ignored the complaint
it did no good being nice to that ungrateful child never satisfied always whining about something or other
oh hello miss pulaski ive been feeling a bit weakly thank you but nothing can keep me from a party sydelles crutch was painted in black and white squares to match her black and white checkered dress
her large hoop earrings were also black and white the white one dangled from her left ear the black from her right
the party is such a lovely idea grace said warming up to the owner of the shorthand notes
when i saw the invitation in the elevator i suggested to mr hoo that he call the judge to see if she needed hors doeuvres and sure enough he got an order for six dozen she turned to angela
hadnt you better get dressed dear
its getting late
its too bad doctor d cant escort you to the party but your father and i will take you angela and i are going together were partners you know sydelle had it all planned
they were to appear in  identical costumes tonight was the night they would discover if one of the heirs was a twin
im going to the party with mrs baumbach turtle remarked
the sign said everyones invited again grace ignored her
by the way miss pulaski i do hope youve changed your mind about showing me your notes it was the secretarys turn to seal her lips
she wouldnt put it past that uppity grace windsor wexler to steal the notebook from an unfortunate cripple and then rub it in
grace tried again her voice dripping with honey
you know of course that if i do win the inheritance everything i own goes to angela turtle bounded up
let me out of here a person cant breathe in this closet she kicked the bed kicked the chair kicked the desk and elbowed past the disapproving secretary
what in the world is wrong with that child her mother said
judge ford was instructing theo in the art of bartending when the telephone rang
the snowbound newspaperman had found several items in the files
first the engagement announcement of angela wexler to d denton deere
next several clippings on a lawsuit brought against sam westing by an inventor named… hold on please mr hoo waddled in with a large tray of appetizers
the judge pointed him to the serving buffet and apologized to her caller
im sorry would you repeat that name  james hoo
he claimed westing stole his idea of the disposable paper diaper one minute please the judge cupped her hand over the mouthpiece
please dont leave mr hoo
i was hoping youd stay for the party as a guest of course
your wife and son too hoo grunted
he hated parties
he had seen his fill of people eating and drinking and acting like clowns jabbering like…so thats it jabbering dropping clues
ill be right back the receiver hissed with an impatient sigh then the researcher went on
ive got a thick file of sports items on another hoo a doug hoo
seems he runs a pretty fast mile for a highschool kid
thats all i could find on the names you gave me but i still have stacks of westing clippings to go through thank you so much the doorbell rang
the party was about to begin
10  the long party  i hope were not too early grace windsor wexler always arrived at parties fashionably late but not tonight
she didnt want to miss a thing or a clue or wait around in her apartment with a murderer on the loose
i dont think youve met my husband doctor wexler  call me jake hello jake judge ford said
a firm handshake laugh lines around his eyes
he needed a sense of humor with that socialclimbing wife
what a lovely living room so practically furnished grace commented
our apartments are identical in layout but mine looks so different
you must come see what ive done with it
im a decorator you know
three bedrooms do seem rather spacious for a single woman what does she mean three bedrooms
this is a onebedroom apartment
would you care for an appetizer mrs wexler
im curious to know exactly how you are related to the westing family the judge had hoped to take the heiress by surprise but grace gained time by coughing
goodness that ginger is spicyits the szechuan cooking style you know
how am i related
let me see uncle sam was my fathers oldest brother or was he the youngest brother of my fathers father excuse me i have to greet my other guests the judge left the prattling pretender
fathers brother or fathers fathers brother if the relationship was on the paternal side her maiden name would be westing
the party went on and on
no one dared be first to leave
safety in numbers especially with a judge there
so the guests ate and drank and jabbered and they watched the other guests eat and drink and jabber
no one laughed
i guess murder isnt very funny jake wexler said
neither is money mr hoo replied glumly
deciding that his wife had found the perfect partner the podiatrist moved on to the two women standing in silence at  the front window
cheer up angiepie youll see your denton soon enough his daughter twisted out of his embrace
are you all right angela im fine she was not fine
why did they ask about denton all the time as though she was nobody without him
oh it wasnt just that
it wasnt even the humiliation of her mother chiding her about the twin costume in front of everybody and sending her back to their apartment to change clothes
it was more than that it was everything
jake turned to madame hoo
hi there partner she doesnt speak english dad angela said flatly
and she never will angela if no one talks to her snow said madame hoo
jake followed her pointing finger
thats right snow
lots and lots of snow
snow
trees
road
lake michigan china said madame hoo
china
sure why not jake replied
china angela left the chatting couple
why couldnt she have made some sort of friendly gesture
because she might do the wrong thing and annoy her mother
angelatheobedientdaughter did only what her mother told her to do
hello angela
one of these tidbits might cheer you up judge ford held the tray before her
i hear youll be getting married soon some people have all the luck sydelle pulaski said appearing from nowhere to lean over the tray to spear a cube of pork
of course not all us women have opted for marriage right judge ford
some of us prefer the professional life though i must say if a handsome young  doctor like denton deere proposed to me i might just change my mind
too bad he doesnt happen to be twins excuse me the judge moved away
im not having any luck at all angela sydelle whined
if only your mother hadnt made you change clothes someone surely would have mentioned twin its much harder to judge reactions when i have to bring up the subject myself
you shouldnt let your mother boss you like that youre a grown woman about to be married excuse me angela moved away
yes thank you i would like a refill sydelle said to nobody and hobbled to the bar
something nonalcoholic please doctors orders
make it a doubletwins twins
whats she talking about theo wondered staring at the black and white checkered costume
two ginger ales for the chessboard coming right up hidden among her guests the judge studied the two people standing off in the corner the only pair in sunset towers who were not westing heirs
george theodorakis placed his hand on the shoulder of his invalid son
a large bronze hardworking hand
like theos
theo resembled him in so many ways tall wide shoulders slimwaisted the same thick straight black hair but age had chiseled the fathers face into sharper planes
his troubled eyes stared across the room at angela
catherine theodorakis a slight careworn woman gazed down on her younger son with tired darkcircled eyes
from his wheelchair chris watched legs
other than the funny lady with the shorthand notes the only limpers were his  brother theo turtle had kicked him again and mrs wexler who stood on one leg rubbing her stockinged foot against her calf
a highheeled shoe stood alone on the carpet beneath her
judge ford didnt limp besides she couldnt be a murderer in spite of his clues
nobody here looks like a murderer theyre all nice people even this fat chinese man who grumbles all the time
george theodorakis greeted mr hoo with hows business hoo spun around and stomped off from his fellow restaurant owner in a huff of anger
james hoo inventor thats who the judge wanted to talk to but there was a problem at the bar
a long line had formed and it wasnt moving
there are sixteen white pieces and sixteen black pieces in chess theo was explaining to sydelle pulaski
do you play chess judge ford a bit but i havent played in years the judge led the secretary away from the crowded bar
theo must think the westing game has something to do with chess
he may be right it certainly is as complicated as a chess game
but i did study doug was arguing
the judge interrupted
i havent had a chance to thank you for the delicious food mr hoo
how long have you been in the restaurant business running up and down stairs is not studying hoo said
sydelle pulaski butted in
father and son
you look more like twins youre equal partners with that theodorakis kid hoo continued
why didnt you insist on holding the meeting in our restaurant instead of that greasy coffee shop  because some people dont like chow mein for breakfast sydelle pulaski replied
there you are dear grace patted a stray wisp of angelas hair into place
we must do something about your coiffure
ill make an appointment for you with my hairdresser once the snow is cleared long hair is too youthful for a woman about to be married
i cant understand what got into you angela coming to this party in that old checkered dress and those awful accessories
just because your partner dresses like a freak… shes not a freak mother i was just speaking to mr hoo about catering the wedding shower on saturday i arranged for little madame hoo to serve in one of those slinky chinese gowns
where are you going
angela angela rushed into judge fords kitchen
she had to get away she had to be alone by herself or shed burst out crying
she was not alone
crow was there
the two women stared at each other in surprise then turned away
poor baby
crow wanted to reach out to the pretty child she wanted to take her in her arms and say poor poor baby go ahead and cry but she couldnt
all she could say was here angela took the dish towel from the cleaning woman and bunched it against her face to muffle the wrenching sobs
the guests jabbering on and on about the weather about food about football about chess about twins
turtle was slumped on the couch scornful of dumb grownup parties
youd think one of them would know something about the  stock market
she missed sandy
sandy was the only one in this dumb building she could talk to
remember that quotation may god thy gold refine flora baumbach asked
lets take a poll
ill bet ten cents its from the bible shakespeare turtle argued and make it ten dollars oh my
well all right ten dollars together they made the rounds
four votes for the bible three for shakespeare and one abstention madame hoo did not understand the question
sydelle pulaski voted for the bobbsey twins
and how do you know those words were in the will she asked suspiciously
too suspiciously
so thats what lost important business papers meant
somebody stole the shorthand notes
turtle smiled at the delicious nastiness of it all
i remember thats all if you remember so well tell me what comes before that sydelle challenged
i dont know what the secretary had an audience now
i dont mind telling you but not if you ask like that theo said please not turtle
sydelle turned toward him with what should have been a gracious manner but she grimaced when the top of the crutch poked her in the chest
the exact quotation she announced loudly hoping she was right is spend it wisely and may god thy gold refine right or wrong her guess was received with groans of disappointment
the heirs had expected more a hint a clue something
it was time to go home
11  the meeting  a pale sun rose on the third snowbound morning
lake michigan lay calm violet now blue but the tenants of sunset towers on waking turned to a different view
lured by the westing house they stood at their side windows scoffing at the danger daring to dream
should they or shouldnt they share their clues
well theyd go to the meeting in the coffee shop just to see what the others intended to do
waiting in her closet of a room turtle stared at the whiteweighted branches of the maple on the hill
a twig snapped in silence a flurry speckled the crusted snow
sometimes when her mother was too busy to do her hair she sent angela in but today no one came
they had forgotten about her
brush and comb clutched in her fists like weapons she stormed into apartment 2c
do you know how to braid hair flora baumbachs pudgy fingers swift with a needle were clumsy with a comb but after several tangled attempts she ended up with three equal strands
my what thick hair you have
i tried braiding my daughters hair once but it was too fine soft and wispy like a babys even in her teens that was the last thing turtle wanted to hear
was she pretty your daughter all mothers think their children are beautiful
rosalie was an exceptional child they said but she was the lovingest person that ever was my mother doesnt think im beautiful of course she does  my mother says i looked just like a turtle when i was a baby sticking my head out of the blanket
i still look like a turtle i guess but i dont care
wheres your daughter now gone flora baumbach cleared the catch in her throat
there that braid should hold for the rest of the day
by the way youve never told me your real name alice turtle replied swinging her head before the mirror
not one single hair escaped its tight bind
mrs baumbach would make a good braider if only shed stop yakking about her exceptional child
rosalie what a dumb name
youd better get to the meeting now
remember dont say a word to anyone about anything
just listen all right alice
i promise theo wheeled his brother into the elevator and read the new message on the wall 25 reward for the return of a gold railroad watch inscribed to ezra ford in appreciation of thirty years service to the milwaukee railroad
j j ford apartment 4d  foddd fode chris said
thats right judge ford
must be her fathers watch
probably lost it
i dont think it could have been stolen by anyone at the party last night chris smiled
his brother had not understood him
good
this might be an important discoveryjudge fords name was the same as her apartment number ford 4d
theo led the waiting tenants through the kitchen where mr and mrs theodorakis handed out cups of tea and coffee
sorry weve run out of cream and lemons
please help yourself to some homemade pastries walking into a coffee shop was like entering a cave
a wall of snow pressed against the plateglass window sealing the door that once opened to the parking lot
ive got a car buried out there grace wexler said slipping into a booth opposite her partner
hope i find it before the snowplows do if they ever get here mr hoo replied
good thing this meeting wasnt held in my restaurant id go broke passing out free tea if you call this tea he held up a tea bag with contempt then groaned on seeing his sweatsuited son jog in with a sweet roll between his teeth and vault over his hands onto a stool
wheres your daughter the turtle grace wexler looked around
i dont know maybe shes helping her father with his bookkeeping bookkeeping mr hoo let out a whoop
grace had no idea what was so funny but she joined him in loud laughter
nothing stirred peoples envy more than a private joke
thinking she was being laughed at sydelle pulaski dropped her polka dot crutch and spilled her coffee on angelas tapestry bag before managing a solid perch on the counter stool
clink clink
theo tapped a spoon against a glass for attention
thank you for coming
when the meeting is over you are all welcome to stay for a chess tournament
meanwhile id like to explain why my partner and me…my partner and i…called this meeting
i dont know about your  clues but our clues dont make any sense the heirs stared at him with blank faces no one nodded no one even blinked
now then if no two sets of clues are alike as the will says that could mean that each set of clues is only part of one message
the more clues we put together the better chance we have of finding the murderer and winning the game
of course the inheritance will be divided into equal shares sydelle pulaski raised her hand like a schoolgirl
what about the clues that are in the will itself yes wed appreciate having a copy of the will ms pulaski theo replied
well equal shares doesnt seem quite fair since im the only one here who thought of taking notes sydelle turned to the group one penciled eyebrow arched high over her red sequined spectacles
her selfcongratulatory pose was too much for mr hoo
grunting loudly he squeezed out of the booth and slapped the shorthand pad on the counter
thief the secretary shrieked nearly toppling off the stool as she grabbed her notebook
thief i did not steal your notebook the indignant hoo explained
i found it on a table in my restaurant this morning
you can believe me or not i really dont care because those notes you so selfishly dangled under our noses are completely worthless
my partner knows shorthand and she says your shorthand is nothing but senseless scrawls
jibberish pure jibberish grace wexler added
those are standard shorthand symbols all right but they dont translate into words  thief sydelle cried now accusing mrs wexler
thief
larcenist
felon dont sydelle angela said softly her eyes set on the d she was embroidering
you wouldnt understand angela you dont know what its like to be… her voice broke
she paused then lashed out at her enemies all of them
who cares a fig about sydelle pulaski
nobody thats who
im no fool you know
i knew i couldnt trust any one of you
you cant read my shorthand because i wrote in polish polish
when the meeting was again called to order mr hoo suggested they offer ms pulaski a slightly larger share of the inheritance in exchange for a transcript of the willin english
however i repeat neither my partner nor i stole the notes
and if anyone here suspects us of murder forget it we both have airtight alibis doug choked on his sweet roll
if it got around to alibis theyd find out where he was the night of the murder
on the westing house lawn
mr hoo went on
and to prove our innocence my partner and i agree to share our clues one minute mr hoo judge ford stood
it was time for her to speak before matters got out of hand
let me remind you all of you that a person is innocent until proven guilty
we are free to choose whether or not to share our clues without any implication of guilt
i suggest we postpone any decision until we have given the matter careful thought and until the time all of the heirs can attend
however since we  are assembled i have a question to ask of the group perhaps others do too they all did
wary of giving away game plans the heirs decided the questions would be written out but no names were to be signed
doug collected the scraps of paper and handed them to theo
is anyone here a twin he read
no one answered
what is turtles real name doug hoo was planning another nasty sign
tabitharuth replied mrs wexler with a bewildered look at flora baumbach who said alice well which is it tabitharuth wexler
i should know im her mother doug changed his mind about the sign
he couldnt spell tabitharuth
theo unfolded the next question
how many here have actually met sam westing grace wexler raised her hand lowered it raised it halfway then lowered it again torn between her claim as sam westings relative and being accused of murder
mr hoo an honest man held up his hand and kept it up
his was the only one
judge ford did not think it necessary to respond to her own question
theo recognized the sprawling handwriting of the next question who got kicked last week chris did not receive an answer
the meeting was adjourned due to panic
12   the first bomb  it was so sudden the earsplitting bangs the screams the confusion
theo and doug ran into the kitchen mrs theodorakis ran out
her hair her face her apron were splattered with dark dripping red
blood sydelle pulaski cried clutching her heart
dont just sit there catherine theodorakis shouted somebody call the fire department angela hurried to the pay phone on the wall and stood there trembling not knowing whether to call or not
they were snowbound the fire engines could not reach sunset towers
theo leaned through the kitchen doorway
everythings okay
theres no fire chris honey its all right mrs theodorakis said kneeling before the wheelchair
its all right chris look
its just tomato sauce tomato sauce
mrs theodorakis was covered with tomato sauce not blood
the curious heirs now piled into the kitchen except for sydelle pulaski who slumped to the counter
she could have a heart attack and no one would notice
mr hoo surveyed the scene trying to conceal his delight
what a mess he said
that row of cans must have exploded from the heat of the stove the entire kitchen was splattered with tomato sauce and soaked in foam from the fire extinguishers
what a mess george theodorakis regarded him with suspicion
it was a bomb  catherine theodorakis thought so too
there was hissing then bang bang sparks flying all over the kitchen red sparks purple sparks cans of tomato sauce exploded doug hoo said defending his father
the others agreed
mrs theodorakis was understandably hysterical
a bomb
ridiculous
sam westing certainly did not appear to have been killed by a bomb
judge ford suggested that the accident be reported to the police immediately in order to collect on the insurance
you might as well redecorate the entire kitchen grace wexler decorator proposed
it should be functional yet attractive with lots of copper pots hanging from the ceiling i dont think theres any real damage catherine theodorakis replied but well have to close for a few days to clean up mr hoo smiled
angela offered to help
angela dear you have a fitting this afternoon grace reminded her and we have so much to do for the wedding shower on saturday in thumped sydelle pulaski
im fine now just a bit woozy
goodness what a nasty turn having recovered from the nasty turn sydelle pulaski settled down to transcribing her shorthand to polish then from polish to english
startled by loud banging on her apartment door she struck the wrong typewriter key
open up recognizing the voice angela unbolted the door to a furious turtle
all right angela where is it what  the newspaper you took from my desk angela carefully dug through the embroidery personal items and other paraphernalia in her tapestry bag and pulled out the newspaper folded to the westing obituary
im sorry turtle
i would have asked for it but you werent around you dont also happen to have my mickey mouse clock in there too do you turtle softened on seeing her sisters hurt expression
im only kidding
you left your engagement ring on the sink again
better go get it before somebody steals that too oh i wouldnt worry about anyone stealing angelas ring sydelle pulaski remarked
no mother would stoop that low the thought of grace being the burglar was so funny to turtle she plopped down on the sofa and rolled about in laughter
it felt good to laugh the stock market had fallen five points today
angela please tell your sister to get her dirty shoes off my couch
tell her to sit up and act like a lady turtle rose with a tongue click very much like her mothers but she was not about to leave without striking back
arms folded she leaned against the wall and let them have it
mom thinks angela was the one who stole the shorthand notebook that got them
look at those open mouths
because mom asked to see it and angela does everything she says anyone could have stolen my notebook i didnt double lock my door that day if sydelle couldnt trust her own partner she was alone all alone
did mom really say that angela asked
no but i know how she thinks i know what everybody thinks
grownups are so obvious ridiculous scoffed sydelle
for instance i happen to know that angela doesnt want to marry that sappy intern ridiculous
youre just jealous of your sister maybe turtle had to admit but i am what i am
i dont need a crutch to get attention oh oh she had gone too far
turtle didnt mean it that way sydelle angela said quickly
she used the word crutch as a symbol
she meant you know that people are so afraid of revealing their true selves they have to hide behind some sort of prop oh really sydelle replied
then turtles crutch is her big mouth no angela thought hurrying her sister out of the door and back to their apartment turtles crutch is her braid
the newspaperman called again to say he had found some photographs taken at westingtown parties twenty years ago
one of those names appears in a caption as violet westings escort george theodorakis go on the judge said
thats all he promised to send her the clippings in the westing file as soon as he was shoveled out
the judge now knew of four heirs with westing connections james hoo the inventor theos father her partner sandy mcsouthers who had been fired from the westing paper mill and herself
but she had to learn more  much more about each one of the heirs if she hoped to protect the victim of sam westings revenge
she would have to hire a detective a very private detective who had not been associated with her in her practice or in the courts
j j ford flipped through the yellow pages to investigatorsprivate
good grief her finger stopped near the top of the list
was it a coincidence or dumb luck
or was she playing right into sam westings hand
no choice but to chance it
the judge dialed the number and tapped her foot impatiently waiting for an answer
hello
if youre looking for a snowbound private investigator youve got the right number yes she had the right number
it may be a trick but it was no coincidence
the voices were one and the same
13  the second bomb  no one was in the kitchen of shin hoos restaurant when the bomber set a tall can labeled monosodium glutamate behind similar cans on a shelf
the colorstriped candle would burn down to the fuse at sixthirty whoever was working there would be at the other end of the room
no one would be hurt
due to the unfortunate damage to the coffee shop shin hoos restaurant is prepared to satisfy all dinner accommodations
order down or ride up to the fifth floor
treat your taste buds to a scrumptious meal while feasting your eyes on the stunning snowscape before it melts away
reasonable prices too
grace wexler tacked her sign to the elevator wall as she rode up to her new job
she was going to be the seating hostess
wheres the cook mr hoo shouted meaning his wife
he found madame hoo in their rear fourthfloor apartment kneeling before her bamboo trunk fingering mementoes from her childhood in china
he hurried her up to the kitchen too harried to find the words that would explain what was happening
now where was that lazy son of his
doug jogged in from a tiring workout on the stairs
how was he supposed to know the restaurant would open early
nobody bothered telling him
some student you are anyone with the brain of an anteater could have figured that out people are short of food the coffee shop is closed for repairs
stop arguing go take a shower and put on your busboy outfit
get moving dont you think youre rather hard on the boy grace commented
somebodys got to give him a shove
if he had his way hed do nothing but run hoo replied between bites of chocolate
youre not so easy on angela either angela
angela was born good the perfect child
as for the other one well… its not easy being a parent hoo said woefully
you can say that again grace held her breath
her husband would have done just that said it again but mr hoo only nodded in shared sympathy
what a gentleman
only mr and mrs theodorakis ordered down
the other tenants of sunset towers lined up at the reservations desk waiting for grace windsor wexler to lead the way
oversized menus clutched in her arms grace felt the first proud stirrings of power rush up from her pedicured toes to the very top curl on her head
if uncle sam could pair off people so could she
you see your brother every day chris how about eating with someone else for a change she wheeled the boy to a window table without waiting for an answer
it would have been yes
the two cripples together sydelle pulaski thought
shed show that high and mighty hostess shed show them all
she and chris could have private jokes too and everybody would be sorry they werent sitting with them
whas moo ggoo ggipn chris asked baffled by the strange words on the menu
i think its boiled grasshopper sydelle screwed up her face and chris laughed
or chocolatecovered moose frensshfry mmouse chris offered
now sydelle laughed
they both laughed heartily but no one envied them
your brother seems to be enjoying ms pulaski theo nodded awed by the beautiful angela three years older than he so fairskinned and blonde so unattainable
here he was sitting at the very same table with her just the two of them and he couldnt think of a single thing to say that wasnt stupid or childish or childishly stupid
usually the quiet one angela tried again
are you planning to go to college next year theo nodded then shook his head
say something idiot
i got a scholarship to madison but im not going
im going to work instead what big worried skyblue eyes
the operation for chris will be very expensive that was worse now shes feeling sorry for him
if chris had been born that way maybe it wouldnt be so bad but he was a perfectly normal kid a great kid
and hes smart too
about four years ago he started to get clumsy just little things at first perhaps my fiancé can help angela bit her lip
theo was not asking for charity
and fiancé what an oldfashioned silly word
i went to college for a year
i wanted to be a doctor but well we dont have as much money as my mother pretends
dad said he could manage if thats what i really wanted but my mother said it was too difficult for a woman to get into medical school why was she gabbing like this
i want to be a writer theo said
that really sounded like kid stuff
would you go back to college if you won the inheritance angela looked down
it was a question she did not want to answer
or could not answer
long before becoming a judge josiejo ford had decided to stop smiling
smiling without good reason was demeaning
a serious face put the smiler on the defensive a rare smile put a nervous witness at ease
she now bestowed one of her rare smiles on the dressmaker
im so glad we have this chance to become acquainted mrs baumbach
i had so little time to chat with my guests last night  it was a wonderful party flora baumbach appeared even smaller and rounder than she was as she sat twisting her napkin with hands accustomed to being busy
was her face permanently creased from years of pleasing customers or was a tragedy lurking behind that grin
have you always specialized in wedding gowns mr
baumbach and i had a shop for many years baumbachs for the bride and groom
perhaps youve heard of it im afraid not the judge would have said no in any case to keep her witness talking
perhaps youve heard of floras bridal gowns
thats what i called my shop after my husband left
i dont know much about grooms clothes theyre mostly rentals anyway flora baumbach lost her timidity the judge let her chat away
im using heirloom lace on the bodice of angelas gown its been in my family for three generations
i wore it at my wedding and i dreamed that someday id have a daughter who would wear it too but rosalie didnt come along until i was in my forties and… the dressmaker stopped
her lips tightened into an even wider grin
angela will make such a beautiful bride
funny how she reminds me of her angela reminds you of your daughter the judge asked
oh my no
angela reminds me of another young girl i made a wedding dress for violet westing the heavy charms on sydelle pulaskis bracelet clinked and clunked as she raised a full fork and flourished it in a practiced ritual before aiming it at her open mouth
chriss movements were even jerkier
shes a good person he thought but she  thinks too much about herself
maybe she never had anybody to love
here let me help you to some of this delicious sweet and sour ostrich their laughter drowned out the loud groan from another table where turtle sat alone a transistor radio plugged in her ear
the stock market had dropped another twelve points
im starved lets sit down to eat head held high grace wexler led her husband across the restaurant
all i want is a corned beef sandwich not a guided tour would you prefer to sit alone or with that young lady over there i thought i was going to sit with you please be seated grace replied
jimmy i mean mr hoo will take your order shortly jake snatched the menu from his wife and watched her glide gracefully he had to admit to the reservations desk and whisper in hoos ear
jimmy she calls him
thats a fine kettle of fish he exclaimed then turned to his dinner companion
fine kettle of fish
im so hungry even that sounds good and from the looks of this menu thats probably what ill get im okay turtle replied the final prices of actively traded stocks tumbling in her ear
mr hoo waddled over
i recommend the striped bass see what did i tell you a kettle of fish turtle switched off the radio
she had heard enough bad news for one day
how about spareribs done to a crisp hoo suggested then he lowered his voice
whats the point spread on the packers game see me later jake muttered
go ahead and tell him daddy turtle said
i know youre a bookie can you stand on your legs sydelle pulaski asked
can you walk at all people never asked chris those questions they whispered them to his parents behind his back
nnno
why what better disguise for a thief or a murderer than a wheelchair the perfect alibi chris enjoyed being taken for the criminal type
now they really were friends
when you ree mmme nos what
oh read you my notes
soon very soon sydelle daintily touched the corners of her mouth with the napkin pushed back her chair and grabbed her polka dot crutch
that was a superb meal i must give my compliments to the chef she rose knocking the chair to the floor and clumped toward the kitchen door
where is she going angela starting up to help her partner was distracted by shouting in the corridor
hello in there anybody home through the restaurant door came a bundled and booted figure
he danced an elephantine jig stomping snow on the carpet flung a long woolen scarf from his neck and yelled otis amber is here the roads are clear thats when the bomb went off
nobody move
everybody stay where you are mr hoo shouted as he rushed into the sizzling crackling kitchen
just a little mishap grace wexler explained taking her command post in the middle of the restaurant
nothing to worry about
eat up before your food gets cold a cluster of red sparks hissed through the swinging kitchen door kissed the ceiling and rained a shimmering shower down and around the petrified hostess
fireflies of color faded into her honeyblonde hair and scattered into ash at her feet
nothing to worry about she repeated hoarsely
just celebrating the chinese new year otis amber shouted adding one of his hehehe cackles
mr hoo leaned through the kitchen doorway his shiny straight black hair even shinier and straighter plastered to his forehead water dribbling down his moonshaped face
call an ambulance theres been a slight accident angela dashed past mr hoo into the kitchen
jake wexler made the emergency telephone call and sent theo to the lobby to direct the ambulance attendants
why are you standing there like a statue hoo shouted at his son
you told everybody to stay where they were doug said
youre not everybody madame hoo tried to make the injured woman as comfortable as possible on the debrisstrewn floor
angela found the sequined spectacles wiped off the wet crystalline mess and placed them on her partners nose
dont look so worried angela
im all right sydelle was in pain but she wanted attention on her own terms not as a hapless foolish victim of fate
looks like a fracture an ambulance attendant said feeling her right ankle
careful how you lift her the secretary suppressed a grunt
it was bad enough being drenched by the overhead sprinkler and draped with noodles now they were carrying her right past them all
grace pulled angela away from the stretcher
you can visit your friend in a few days angela angela sydelle moaned
pride or not she wanted her partner at her side
angela stood between her determined mother and her distraught partner paralyzed by the burden of choice
go with your friend angiepie jake wexler said
other voices chimed in
go with pulaski grace realized she had lost
perhaps you should go to the hospital angela its been so long since youve seen your doctor d she winked mischievously but only flora baumbach smiled back
the policeman and the fire inspector visiting the scene agreed that it was nothing more than a gas explosion
good thing the sprinkler system worked or mr hoo might have had a good fire
what kind of a fire is a good fire hoo wanted to know
and what about the burglaries grace wexler asked
im with the bomb squad the policeman explained
youll have to call the robbery detail for that and what about the coffee shop accident theo asked
also a gas explosion jake wexler asked about the odds of having two explosions in two days in the same building
nothing unusual the fireman replied especially in weather like this no ventilation snow packed over the ducts he instructed the tenants to air out their kitchens before lighting ovens
mrs wexler turned up the heat in her apartment and kept the windows open for the next three days
she did not want anything blowing up during angelas party
but the wexler apartment was exactly where the bomber planned to set the next bomb
14   pairs repaired  the snowplows plowed and a warm sun finished the job of freeing the tenants of sunset towers and the figure in the westing house from their wintry prisons
angela disguised in her mothers old beaver coat and hat and in turtles red boots was the first one out
following sydelles instructions she hastily searched under the hood of every car in the parking lot
nothing was there nothing that is that didnt seem to belong to an automobile engine
so much for good gracious from hood space
next came flora baumbach
behind her a bootless turtle tiptoed through puddles
miracle of miracles the rusty and battered chevy started but the dressmakers luck went downhill from there
first the hood of her car flew up in the middle of traffic
then after two hours of watching mysterious symbols move across the lighted panel high on the  wall of the brokers office her eyes began to cross
after three hours the grin faded from her face
im getting dizzy she said shifting her position on the hard wooden folding chair and worse yet i think ive got a splinter in my fanny look there goes one of our stocks turtle replied
 sea  gm 58½  lvi 500067  mgc 32¼  t ami i 214 100065¼ 319¼ 822½   flora baumbach caught a glimpse of sea 58½ as it was about to magically disappear off the left edge of the moving screen
oh my ive forgotten what that means turtle sighed
it means five hundred shares of sea was traded at 850 a share what did we pay never mind just write down the prices of our stocks as they cross the tape like im doing
once school opens its all up to you turtle did not tell her partner that they had bought two hundred shares of sea at 1525 a share
on that stock alone they had a loss of 1350 not counting commissions
it took nerves of steel to play the stock market
the mercedes is wiped clean and shiny like new the doorman boasted
his face reddened around old scars as he rejected a folded five dollar bill
no tips judge please not after all youve done for the wife and me the judge had given him the entire ten thousand dollars
j j ford pocketed the bill and to make amends for her thoughtless gesture asked the doorman about his family
sandy perched on the edge of a straightbacked chair adjusted his round wireframed glasses repaired at the bridge with adhesive tape across his broken nose and told about his children
two boys still in high school one daughter married and expecting my third grandchild her husband just lost his job so they all moved in with us another daughter who works parttime as a typist she plays the piano real good and two sons who work in a brewery it must have been difficult supporting such a large family the judge said
not so bad
i picked up odd jobs here and there after i got fired from the westing plant for trying to organize the union but mostly i boxed
i wasnt no middleweight contender but i wasnt bad either
got my face smashed up a few times too many though still get some pretty bad headaches and my brain gets sort of fuzzy
some dummy of a partner you got stuck with huh judge well do just fine partner judge fords attempt at familiarity fell flat
i did try to phone you but your name was not listed we dont have a phone no more couldnt afford it with the kids making so many calls
but i did make some headway on our clues
want to see sandy removed a paper from the inside of his cap and placed it on the desk
judge ford noticed a flask protruding from the back pocket of his uniform but his breath smelled of peppermint
the clues as figured out by alexander mcsouthers  skies  am  shining  brother  skiessikes dr sikes witnessed the will am brotheramber otis amber shiningshin the middle name of james shin hoo or what turtle kicks brothertheo or chris theodorakis remarkable the judge commented to sandys delight
however we are looking for one name not six gee judge i forgot sandy said dejectedly
judge ford told him about theos proposal but sandy refused to go along
it seems too easy the clues adding up to one message especially for a shrewd guy like westing
lets stick it out together just the two of us
after all i got me the smartest partner of them all shallow flattery for the big tipper the judge thought
mcsouthers was not a stupid man if only he was less obsequiousand less of a gossip
the doorman scratched his head
what i cant figure out judge is why im one of the heirs
unless sam westing just up and died and there is no murderer
unless sam westing is out to get somebody from his grave i agree with you entirely mr mcsouthers
what we have to find out is who these sixteen heirs are and which one as you say was westing out to get sandy beamed
they were going to play it his way
what you need is an advertising campaign what i need is my half of the ten thousand dollars  five thousand dollars is what i estimate the redecorating and the newspaper ads will cost get out of here get out grace stared at hoos smooth broad face at the devilish tufts of eyebrow so high above those flashing eyes then she turned her back and walked out
sometimes she wondered about that manno he couldnt be the murderer he couldnt even kill the waterbug in the sink this morning
grace spun around to see if she was being followed on the footstephushing carpet in the third floor hall
no one was there but she heard voices
they were coming from her kitchen
it was nothing just otis amber shouting at crow something about losing their clues
i remember them otis crow replied in a soft voice
she felt strangely at peace
just this morning she had been given the chance to hide her love in angelas bag the big tapestry shoulder bag she carries next to her heart
now she must pray that the boy comes back
i remember them too thats not the point otis amber argued
what if somebody else finds them
crow
are you listening to me crow no but grace wexler was listening
really mr amber cant you find another time to discuss your affairs with my cleaning woman
and where are you going crow crow was buttoned up in a black motheaten winter coat a black shawl covered her head
its freezing in here otis amber shut the window
grace opened the window
the last thing i need is a gas explosion she said peevishly
boom he replied
the two women were so startled that the delivery boy sneaked up on the unsuspecting for the rest of the week shouting boom besides shouting boom otis amber delivered groceries from the shopping center to sunset towers back and forth to and fro
not only did the tenants have to restock their bare shelves they had to add westing paper products by the gross to their orders
idiots just because the will said buy westing paper products he muttered hefting a bulky bag from the compartment attached to his bike
even crow was using westing disposable diapers to polish the silver and westing paper towels to scrub the floors
is that what happened to their clues
poor crow shes taking this game harder than he had expected
shes been acting strange again
boom otis amber shouted as the intern hurried by
idiot muttered denton deere
denton deere paced the floor
listen kid id like to help you but im only an intern specializing in plastic surgery
it would be different if you wanted a nose job or a facelift he had meant to be amusing it sounded cruel
chris had not asked for charity
all he wanted was to play the game with the intern
all the intern wanted was half of the ten thousand dollars
i hear your brother suggested sharing clues
sounds like a fine idea no response
maybe the kid thinks im the murderer
the tenants must think so the way they peered over their shoulders and that delivery boy shouting like that
why me
im a doctor i took an oath to save lives not take them
im a very busy man chris i have lots of sick people  depending on me
oh well plowing his fingers through his stringy mousebrown hair to keep it out of his eyes when would he find time for a haircut
 he seated himself next to the wheelchair
the clues are in my locker
what were they
the rain in spain falls mainly on the plain ffor pplain gggrain shed chris spoke slowly
he had practiced his recitation over and over hour after lonely hour
ggrainoatsotis amber
ffor shedshe fford
fford lives in ffour d ford apartment 4d good thinking chris the intern rose
is that all chris decided not to tell him about the limper on the lawn not until the next time
his partner would have to visit him a next time and a next time as long as he didnt sign the check
now about signing the check denton deere said
chris shook his head
no
on a bench in the lobby angela embroidered her trousseau waiting for denton
dad had tried to teach her to drive but she was too timid he too impatient
why bother with driving lessons her mother said anyone as pretty as you can always find a handsome young man to chauffeur you
she should have insisted
she should have said no just once to her mother just once
it was too late now
theo came in with an armload of books
hi angela
hey i found that quotation or rather the librarian found it
you know may god thy gold refine really angela thought it unnecessary to remind him that it was flora baumbach and turtle who had asked about the quotation not she
what lush lips what white teeth what fine and shiny hair
theo fumbled between the pages of a chemistry book for the index card
on it was written the third verse of america the beautiful america
america
may god thy gold refine till all success be nobleness and every gain divine
theo had begun reading the refrain and ended up singing
he shyly laughed off his foolishness
i guess it doesnt have anything to do with money or the will just uncle sams patriotism popping up again thank you theo angela stuffed her embroidery in the tapestry bag on seeing denton deere rush off the elevator
hello doctor deere how about a game of chess lets go the intern said ignoring theo
sandy opened the front door for the couple whistling america the beautiful the doorman was a good whistler thanks to his chipped front tooth
i cant drive you home im on duty tonight ill take a cab why must you go back to the hospital
your crazy partner isnt dying you know shes not crazy she made up her socalled wasting disease i call that crazy
nothing was wrong with her legs until the explosion in the chinese restaurant  youre wrong first you ask me to look in on her now you dont want my opinion
anyhow i called in a psychiatrist
maybe you should talk to him too
ive never seen you so troubled
whats wrong the wedding dress isnt ready the guest list is too long
youll have to cope with more important matters than that once were married
unless you dont want to get married
is that it angela twisted the engagement ring her mother made her wear in spite of the rash
no she did not want to get married not right away but she couldnt say it she couldnt tell him them not like that
denton would be so hurt her mother…the engagement was announced in the newspaper the wedding gown the shower…but once they found out she wasnt their perfect angela… how long has she been sitting here in the hospital corridor
a man in a business suit the psychiatrist
came out of sydelles room
you must be angela he said
how had sydelle described hera pretty young thing
i hear youre going to marry one of our interns she was going to get married her one claim to fame
how is ms pulaski doctor do you mean is she crazy
no
no more or less than anybody else in town but the crippling disease she made that up so what
the woman was lonely and wanted some attention so she did something about it
and quite creatively too
those painted crutches are a touch of genius is that normal
i mean its not insane to shock people into noticing who you are  the doctor patted angelas cheek as though she were a child
no one was hurt by her little deception
now go in and say hello to your friend hello sydelle without makeup without jewelry clothed only in a white hospital gown she looked older softer
she looked like a sad and homely human being
you talk to the doctors its a simple fracture angela replied
what else sydelle turned her face to the wall
the doctor says your disease is incurable but you could have a remission lasting five years even more if you take good care of yourself and dont overdo it the doctor said that maybe a few people could be trusted
did you bring my makeup
i must look a mess in the overstuffed tapestry bag under sydelles cosmetic case angela found a letter
it was a strange letter written in a tense and rigid hand forgive me my daughter
god bless you my child
delight in your love and the devil take doctor dear
hast thou found me o mine enemy
the time draws near
taped at the bottom were two clues thy  beautiful  15  fact and gossip  friday was back to normal if the actions of suspicious wouldbe heirs competing for a twohundredmilliondollar prize could be considered normal
at school theo studied doug hoo ran and turtle was twice sent to the principals office for having been caught with a transistor radio plugged in her ear
the coffee shop was full of diners
shin hoos restaurant had reopened too but no one came
j j ford presided at the bench and sandy mcsouthers presided at the front door whistling chatting collecting tidbits of gossip and adding some of his own
flora baumbach her strained eyes shielded by dark glasses drove turtle to school on her way to the brokers office and picked her up in the late afternoon with a sheet of prices copied from the moving tape
they had lost 3000 in five days
paper losses turtle said
doesnt mean a thing
besides i didnt pick these stocks
mr westing did did he
the dressmaker thought of the clue chris had dropped no stock symbol had five letters or even resembled the word plain
but flora baumbach played fair and kept the secret to herself
four people stood in the driveways melting snow shivering as the sun dropped behind sunset towers
the fifth jogged in place
no smoke had risen from the chimney since that fateful  halloween still they stared up at the westing house murder on their minds
he looked too peaceful to have been murdered turtle said
she sneezed and sandy handed her a westing tissue
how would you know doug replied
how many people have you seen murdered turtles right her friend sandy said
if westing expected it hed have seen it coming
his face would have looked scared maybe he didnt see it coming theo argued
the killer was very cunning westing said
i read a mystery once where the victim was allergic to bee stings and the murderer let a bee in through an open window the window wasnt open turtle said wiping her nose
besides westing would have heard the buzzing and jumped out of bed doug had an idea
maybe the murderer injected bee venom in his veins otis amber flung his arms in the air
whoever said sam westing was allergic to bees doug tried again
how about snake venom
or poison
doctors know lots of poisons that make it look like heart attacks turtle almost kicked doug track meet or not
her father was a doctor
she would not have minded if he had said interns i once heard about a murderer who stabbed his victim with an icicle the doorman said
it melted leaving no trace of a murder weapon thats a good one turtle exclaimed appreciatively
sandy had more
then there was a roman who choked on a single goat hair someone put in his milk
and there was the greek poet who was killed when an eagle dropped a tortoise on his bald head maybe westing was just sleeping until turtle stumbled and fell on his head doug suggested
thats not funny doug hoo how could she ever have had a crush on that disgusting jerk
doug would not let up
and who was that suspicious person in red boots i saw opening the hoods of cars in the parking lot the other morning he looked at turtles booted feet
the thief stole my boots and put them back again
they leak a likely story tabitharuth doug pulled her braid and ran into the lobby at full speed
sandy placed a large hand on turtles shoulder a comforting hand and a restraining one
otis amber hopped on his bike
cant stand around chitchatting about a murder that never happened
sam westing was a madman
insane
crazy as a bedbug he pedaled off shouting back we aint murderers none of us theo could not agree
if there was no murderer there was no answer and without an answer no one could win
sandy did anybody leave sunset towers on halloween night before turtle and doug the doorman scratched his head under his hat thinking
one day seems like the next people coming and going
i cant remember try  sandy scratched harder
only ones i recall are otis amber and crow
they left together about five oclock thanks theo hurried into the building to check his clues
turtle had no reason to suspect otis amber or crow or any of the heirs
money was the answer
her only problem was that dumb stock market it didnt want to play the game
sandy tell me another story okay lets see
once long ago in the olden days there was this soothsayer who predicted the day of his own death
that day came and the soothsayer waited to die and waited some more but nothing happened
he was so surprised and so happy to be alive that he laughed and laughed
then at one minute to midnight he suddenly died
he died laughing he died laughing turtle repeated thoughtfully
thats profound sandy
thats very profound wheres everybody the apartment was empty as usual
jake wexler decided that shin hoos was going to have a paying customer
id like a table if youre not too crowded i think i can squeeze you in hoo said leading the podiatrist through the empty restaurant
you must have liked those spareribs yeah sure jake watched his wife slowly stack her papers at the reservations desk
at last seeming to recognize him she walked over
jake returned his unlit cigar to his pocket
grace hated the smell
ive already eaten grace said sitting down
hello to you too jake replied
he probably thinks thats funny
since when do people go around saying hello to their husbands
whats new with you grace
where are the kids
and what are all those presents doing on the coffee table
its not your birthday and its not our anniversary what was she so upset about
or is it no it isnt
those are gifts for angela the wedding shower is tomorrow
dont worry youre not supposed to be there just the girls
the doorbell was ringing all morning i couldnt leave the apartment for an instant one at a time he delivered them the smirking fool and each time he shouted boom she looked especially attractive today jake thought
between the ringing doorbell and the booms she had managed time for the beauty parlor and the sunlamp
mr hoo set the spareribs on the table and lowered himself to a chair
grace lost her scowl
since youre here jake id like your opinion on the advertising campaign im planning
jimmy and i are having a slight disagreement
i say that shin hoos sounds like every other chinese restaurant to englishspeaking ears englishspeaking ears
jake bit his lip in an effort to keep silent
i say the restaurant needs a name people wont forget grace continued
a name like hoos on first jake could not help himself
he tried to cover a loud guffaw with louder coughing
hoo pounded him on the back and apologized for the ginger
you remember that old baseball routine jake grace prompted
yes he did
whos on first
no whats on second whos on first its an idiotic name hoo argued
hoos on first sounds like my restaurant is on first street or worse yet on the first floor
customers will end up in the coffee shop drinking dishwater tea not the way ill promote it they wont grace insisted
well whats your opinion jake the podiatrist put down the sparerib he was about to bite into
hoos on first is a dandy name before he could pick up the rib again hoo whisked the plate off the table
who elected you judge anyhow the judge returned to sunset towers with clippings from the newspapers files
faithful sandy was waiting
hoping to interrogate both george theodorakis and james shin hoo they alternated their dinner orders
one night they would order up the next night they would order down
to their disappointment theo delivered up
they had no questions to ask him but he had one for the doorman
chess sandy replied
sorry dont know the game
im a whiz at hearts though
shooter they call me theo left them to their sandwiches and their work
the private detective the judge had hired was still investigating the heirs so tonights project would be the westing family
judge ford opened the thin folder on mrs westing
mrs westingno first name no maiden name
in the few  newspaper photographs in which she appeared always with her husband the captions read mr and mrs samuel w westing
a shadowy figure a shy woman she seemed to slip behind her husband before the camera clicked or had her face masked by a floppy hat brim
a slim woman dressed in the fashion of the time long loose chemise narrow shoes with sharply rounded toes and high spiked heels
a nervous woman her hands especially in the later pictures were blurred
in the final photograph a black veil covered her face
she seemed to lean unsteadily against the stocky frame of her husband as they left the cemetery
sandy reported his findings
jimmy hoo never met mrs westing
neither did flora baumbach
she said violets fiancé brought her to the shop for fittings
she says its bad luck for a groom to see the bride in the wedding gown before the wedding i guess shes right
well thats it
nobody else admits to having known mrs westing except me you knew her mr mcsouthers the judge asked
well not exactly but i saw her once or twice the doorman described mrs westing as blonde fulllipped a good figure though on the skinny side
mostly i recall those full lips because she had a mole right here he pointed to the right corner of his mouth
judge ford did not remember a mole she remembered coppercolored hair and thin lips but it was so long ago and wellmrs
westing was white
very white
next westings daughter
the judge studied the photograph under the headline violet westing to marry senator  the senator turned out to be a state senator a hack politician now serving a fiveyear jail term for bribery
but flora baumbach was right about the resemblance
violet westing did look like angela wexler
and that was george theodorakis all right dancing with her in the society page clippings
what does it all mean judge sandy asked squinting at the pictures through his smeared glasses
angela looks like westings daughter and theo looks like his father the man violet westing really wanted to marry how did you know that sandy shrugged
it was common gossip at the time that westings daughter killed herself rather than have to marry that crooked politician… now the judge remembered her mother had written her about the tragedy
tell me mr mcsouthers you seem to know whats going on in this building is angela wexler involved with theo in any way oh no sandy was certain of that
angela and her intern seem happy enough with each other
at least i hope so
i mean if sam westing wanted to replay that terrible drama angela wexler would have to die  16   the third bomb  boom grace wexler slammed the door on the delivery boys silly face and returned to her party with a pinkribboned gift
the gossiping guests were sipping jasmine tea from westing paper party cups nibbling on tidbits from westing paper party plates and wiping their fingers on westing paper party napkins
madame hoo served in a tightfitting silk gown slit high up her thigh a costume as oldfashioned and impractical as bound feet
women in china wore blouses and pants and jackets
thats what she would wear when she got home
grace clapped her hands for attention
girls girls
its time for the bridetobe to open her presents
angela you sit here and everybody gather round angela did as her mother said
she lowered herself to a cushion on the floor ringed by gift boxes and surrounded by vaguely familiar faces
she had not invited her few friends from college they were bent on careers this wasnt their thing
these were her mothers friends and the newly married daughters of her mothers friendsand turtle who was leaning against the wall arms folded smirking
lucky turtle the neglected child
read it out loud dear grace ordered as angela opened the card tied to the yellowribboned box
to the bridetobe in the kitchen stuck an asparagus cooker and lots of luck
from cookie barfspringer  thank you angela said wondering which one was the barfspringer
the next gift was an egg poacher
the box in pink ribbons contained another asparagus cooker
i sure hope doctor deere likes asparagus someone remarked
the giver said she could return it for something else although two might come in handy
a doctors wife has so much entertaining to do angela glanced at her watch and reached for the tall thin carton wrapped in gold foil
look how angelas hands are shaking shes as nervous as a groom giggles
bridetobe jitters more giggles
slowly angela unknotted the gold ribbon
carefully she unfolded the gold foil
how neatly she did everything the perfect child not like turtle who ripped off wrappings impatient to see what was inside
hurry up angela youre such a poke turtle complained
suddenly there she was kneeling down to peek under the lid
get away angela cried jerking the gift up and away from her sister as the lid blasted off with a shattering bang
bang
bang
a rapid ratatattat
rockets shooting fireballs bursting comets shrieking sparks sizzling
two dozen framed flower prints falling off the wall
then it was over
screams hushed to whimpers and the trembling guests crawled out from under tables and peered out of closets
is anyone hurt grace wexler asked nervously
other than being scared out of ten years of their lives thank you they were fine
wheres angela angela was still seated on the cushion in the middle of the floor
fragments of the scorched box lay in her burned hands
blood oozed from an angry gash on her cheek and trickled down her beautiful face
heirs beware sam westing had warned
they should have listened
now it was too late
the suspicious heirs gathered in the lobby around the police captain called in by judge ford
one of them was a murderer they thought and one of them was a bomber and one of them was a thief
but which was which and who was who
or could it be one and the same
some game mr hoo grumbled unwrapping a chocolate bar
one ulcer wasnt enough sam westing had to give him three more
some game
the last one alive wins now theres a likely suspect otis amber thought
hoo the inventor hoo the angry man the madman
the last one alive wins flora baumbach repeated
oh my what a terrible thing to say cant trust that dressmaker mr hoo thought
how come shes grinning at a time like this
the captain offered no help at all
neither the bomb squad nor the burglary detail has enough evidence to search the apartments he explained
you call that justice sandy asked
goodnatured sandy couldnt be the one
he wasnt in the building when the first two bombs went off or when the  judges watch was stolen jake wexler thought
on the other hand he sure did hate sam westing
yes mr mcsouthers justice is exactly what i call it not her not the judge in spite of the clues chris thought
unless shes one of those black panthers in disguise
those werent gas explosions those were bombs
right theo pressed the captain
a nice kid that theo
doug too flora baumbach thought
but how often had she seen television interviews of nextdoor neighbors saying cant believe he killed thirteen people he was such a nice kid
oh my oh my whats gotten into me thinking such a thing
the captain would not call them bombs
more like childish pranks he said
childish pranks
that brats capable of anything
turtle stuck her tongue out at the sneering doug hoo
evil pranks of the devil crow muttered
her blessed angela was almost killed
crow could be the one
bring hellfire down on all of us theo whispered to chris but she wasnt in the building when the first two bombs went off yes sshe was no she wasnt the captain described the socalled bombs
just a few fireworks triggered by a squat striped candle set in a tall open jar the ribbon probably hid the air holes in the box
no one would have been hurt if the young lady had not tilted the box toward herself a time bomb grace wexler said glaring at the person who delivered the gifts
an unhappy woman that selfappointed heiress the judge thought
unfulfilled possibly disturbed
capable of the burglaries perhaps but not the bombings
she wouldnt have hurt her own daughterat least not angela
dont look at me like that otis amber shouted at mrs wexler
i dont own no striped candles or no fireworks neither that idiot is the likeliest of all grace thought
but he wasnt around when the coffee shop blew up
oooggg aaahh the excitement was too much for chris theodorakis
that was one heir no one suspected
and angela of course no one could suspect her
otis amber was not even sure of that
still waters run deep he said
hehehe turtle could not let him get away with that even if it was true
otis amber limps chris noted the next day
her family kept reassuring her
youre going to be fine angela just fine the loud snore that erupted from the next hospital bed was sydelle pulaski pretending to be asleep
i still dont remember angela mumbled
her bandaged cheek made speaking difficult
her face hurt her hands hurt hurt very much
traumatic amnesia jake wexler said
it happens after sudden accidents
dont worry angiepie youre going to be fine  youre going to be fine angela just fine grace said despondently
ill be back tomorrow
come turtle in a minute turtle waited for the door to close
she touched her sisters bandaged hand
thanks for what another snore from sydelle
just thanks
the fireworks would have gone off in my face if you hadnt pulled the box toward you
here i brought your tapestry bag i didnt look at your notes or clues honest but she had removed the incriminating evidence
turtle tell me the truth
how bad is it the doctor had to take some glass out of your hands but no stitches
the burns will heal okay and my face some scarring not bad really angela
besides you always said being pretty wasnt important its who you really are that counts angela wondered about that
maybe she was wrong
maybe pretty was important
maybe she was crazy she must have been crazy
dont worry youll still be pretty turtle said
but wow that sure was a dumb thing to do sydelle pulaskis eyes popped open in surprise
quickly she squeezed them shut and uttered another loud snore
well what do you know
her sweet saintly partner was the bomber
good for her
17   some solutions  monday was a gray rainy day
depressing
so was the stock market which fell another six points
turtle was jittery
all the heirs were jittery
the bomb squad was called in several times to examine suspicious parcels
one turned out to be a sealed vacuum cleaner bag full of dust that crow had set behind the incinerator door
another was a box delivered to mrs wexler
in it were bonbons her favorite and a note love and kisses jake
what do you mean how come
cant i send candy to my wife without getting the third degree
i thought you were looking on the thin side okay grace made him eat the first piece
the next day grace received a larger box
in it the bomb squad found one dozen longstemmed roses and a note for no reason at all just love jake
the bomb squad was called again when turtle ran after her partner through the lobby shouting mrs
baumbach mrs baumbach someone thought she had shouted bomb
bomb a hollow wind wailed through damp tuesday
in the morning the stock market rose three points
bullish said flora baumbach
in the afternoon the market dropped five points
bearish said flora baumbach
those were the only two trading terms she had learned
madame hoo a quicker student than the dressmaker had learned more words partner money house tree road pots pans okay football good rain spareribs
her teacher jake  wexler visited her in the kitchen before he sat down to his daily lunch in the chinese restaurant
today his wife and jimmy hoo agreed to eat with their only customer on the promise that he would help them with their clues and not take a share of the inheritance if they won
grace laid their five words on the table
these are clues jake looked down on purple waves for fruited sea
he switched two squares of westing superstrength towels
purple fruited makes more sense
how about grapes or plums grace was about to insist on purple waves but plums reminded her of something
plum she said aloud
plum
wasnt the lawyers name plum youre right grace mr hoo said excitedly
youre absolutely right he tore one of the clues in two fruited
ed purplefruit
ed plum we got it we got it grace cried leaping up to embrace her partner
i never did trust lawyers mr hoo shouted gleefully
what about the other clues for sea waves jake asked but the happy hugging and dancing celebrating pair did not hear him
boom said madame hoo placing a plate of spareribs on the table
that word she had learned from otis amber
sandy was proud of the notebook he bought with its glossy cover photograph of a bald eagle in flight sort of appropriate he explained to the judge fits in with uncle sam and all that
in it he painstakingly entered the information culled from reports the private detective delivered each day to judge  fords office photostats of birth certificates death notices marriage licenses drivers licenses vehicular accident reports criminal records hospital records school records
to these the doorman added the results of his own snooping
my investigator is having a difficult time getting into the notsopublic records of westingtown the judge said
well have to put the westings aside and begin with the heirs since were feasting on chicken with water chestnuts sandy said ill start off with the hoos doug had delivered down
he read aloud from his entry hoo  james shin hoo
born james hoo in chicago
age 50
added shin to his name when he went into the restaurant business because it sounded more chinese
first wife died of cancer five years ago
married again last year
has one son douglas
sun lin hoo
age 28
born in china
immigrated from hong kong two years ago
gossip james hoo married her for her 100yearold sauce

westing connection hoo sued sam westing over the invention of the disposable paper diaper
case never came to court  westing disappeared
settled with the company last year for 25000
thinks he was cheated
latest invention paper innersoles
i can take some credit for those paper innersoles sandy bragged
my feet were killing me standing at the door all day so i said to jimmy jimmy if only somebody would invent a good innersole that didnt take up so much room like those foamrubber things and sure enough he did it
theyre great i got a pair in my shoes now wanna see no thank you the judge was eating
it was past midnight when theo finished his homework in the dim light of the study lamp
the wind was still howling and something a word
a phrase
was still eluding him
he had been studying solutions in chemistry
solutionsthat was it
the solution is simple the will said
he was sure of it
by changing for and thee to the numbers four and three theo was able to arrange the clues into a formula whether or not it was a chemical solution let alone the westing solution was another matter
n  his  for  no  thee  to    nh4no3  but four clue letters were left out isto osit itso otis
otis
he had it a formula for an explosive and the name of the murderer
he had to tell doug
where gggogin  shhh theo smoothed the blanket over his sleepy brother in the next bed struggled into his bathrobe and stumbled over the wheelchair as he tiptoed out of the room
the elevator made too much noise use the stairs
the cement was cold he had forgotten his slippers
two unmarked doors which one
tap tap
tap
a grunting voice dragging footsteps
please let it be doug not mr hoo or judge ford
it was crow
clutching a robe about her gaunt frame her unknotted hair hanging long and limp she tried to focus her dulled eyes on the shocked face of her visitor
theo
theo
the wind i heard the wind
i knew you would come me grasping his hand she pulled him into the maids apartment between 4c and 4d and shut the door
we are sinners yet shall we be saved
let us pray for deliverance then you must go to your angel take her away theo found himself kneeling on the bare floor next to the praying crow
he must be dreaming
amen  18  the trackers  it was flora baumbach who braided turtles hair now sometimes in three strands sometimes four sometimes twined with ribbons while turtle read the wall street journal
listen to this the newly elected chairman of the board of westing paper products corporation julian r eastman  announced from london where he is conferring with european management that earnings from all divisions are expected to double in the next quarter thats nice flora baumbach said not understanding a word of it
turtle gave the order for the day
listen carefully
as soon as you get to the brokers office i want you to sell amo sell sea sell mt and put all the money into wpp
okay oh my
that meant selling every stock mentioned in their clues and buying more shares of westing paper productsat a loss of some thousands of dollars
whatever you say alice youre the smart one flora baumbachs hands were gentle they never hurried or pulled a stray hair
flora baumbach loved her she could tell
i like when you call me alice turtle said but i better not call you mrs baumbach anymore because of the bomb scare you know calling her flora would spoil everything
maybe i could call you mrs baba why not just baba thats exactly what turtle alice wanted to hear
was your daughter rosalie very smart baba my no
youre the smartest child i ever met a real businesswoman turtle glowed behind the wall street journal
i bet rosalie baked bread and patched quilts and dumb stuff like that the dressmakers sure fingers fumbled over the red ribbons she was weaving into a fourstrand braid
rosalie was an exceptional child
the friendliest lovingest…  turtle crumpled the newspaper
lets go
im late for school and youve got that big trade to make but i havent finished tying the ribbons never mind i like them hanging turtle felt like kicking somebody anybody good and hard
sandy was not at the door when they left
he was in apartment 4d neatly writing in his patriotic notebook information gathered on the next heir
baumbach  maiden name flora miller
age 60
dressmaker
husband left her years ago sends no money
she had a retarded daughter rosalie a mongoloid child
sold bridal shop last year after rosalie died of pneumonia age 19
spends most of her time at the stockbrokers
westing connection made wedding gown for violet westing which she never got to wear
flora baumbach
sandy turned to a fresh page propped his feet on the judges desk and began to read the data supplied by the private investigator on otis amber
he laughed so hard he nearly fell off the tilting chair
  haunted by last nights dream theo jogged behind his partner halfway to the high school before he uttered a breathless stop doug hoo stopped
who lives in the apartment next to yours crow
why nothing how come he didnt know that
because no one ever wonders where a cleaning woman lives thats why
but he wasnt like that was he
still it must have been a dream
in the dream the nightmare crow had given him a letter but the only thing he found in his bathrobe pocket this morning was a westing paper hankie
hey wait doug had started off again
i figured out our clues
ammonium nitrate
its used in fertilizers explosives and rocket propellants i knew those clues were a pile of fertilizer doug replied jogging easily
only one thing mattered saturdays big track meet
if he won or came in a fast second hed have his pick of athletic scholarships
he didnt need the inheritance
stand still and listen theo grabbed doug by the shoulders and held him flatfooted to the ground
like it or not were partners and youve got to do your share sure doug replied
his father was angry his partner was angry and a bomber was blowing up sunset towers floor by floor
some game
what do you want me to do follow otis amber head tilted back flora baumbach squirted drops in her eyes blinked and stared again at the moving tape
 hr  wpp 100042½  bry 500039¼  ta 27  z wpp 517¼ 500027¼ 500039½   oh my westing paper products had jumped four and a quarter no four and a half points
her eyes must be blurry from the medicine
the dressmaker sat on the edge of her chair biting her fingernails waiting for wpp to cross the board again
there wpp 40
oh my oh my
this morning she had paid thirtyfive dollars a share
there it goes again wpp 40¼
oh my oh my oh my
after classes instead of running around the indoor track doug hoo jogged out of the gym to the shopping center six blocks away
there was otis amber placing two cake boxes in the compartment of his bike
he picked up a package from the butcher shop and pedaled off unaware of the sweatsuited figure trotting half a block behind him and went into sunset towers to make his deliveries
hi doug
gonna run the mile under four minutes on saturday the doorman asked
sure hope so
do me a favor sandy give a loud whistle when otis amber comes out
okay chiptoothed sandy gave such a loud whistle that otis amber would have been deafened if the flaps of the aviators helmet had not been snug against his ears
leaving his bicycle in the parking lot otis amber boarded a bus
doug ran the five uphill miles to a house with the placard e j
plum attorney
he ran another three uphill  miles after the bus that took the delivery boy to the hospital entrance
doug sank down in a waitingroom chair wiped his face on his sweatshirt and picked up a magazine
fascinated by the centerfold picture he almost missed otis amber who dashed out of the hospital as though fleeing for his life
hiding behind parked cars doug followed the delivery boy to another bus ran four steep miles to a stockbrokers office how is it that all roads go uphill
 from the broker to the high school from the high school downhill at last back to sunset towers
the exhausted track star leaned against the side of the building thankful he was not a longdistance runner
i gotcha otis amber poked a skinny finger into dougs ribs
hehehe he cackled handing the startled runner a letter
its from that lawyer plum
says all the heirs gotta be at the westing house this saturday night
sign here with his last ounce of energy he wrote doug hoo miler on the receipt then slid down the wall to a weary squat
some miler
his feet were blistered his muscles sore he could barely breathe he might never run another step in his life
on receiving the notice of the westing house meeting judge ford canceled her remaining appointments and hurried home
time was running out
sandy read to her from his notebook  amber  otis joseph amber
age 62
delivery  boy
fourthgrade dropout
iq 50
lives in the basement of greens grocery
a bachelor
no living relatives
westing connection delivered letters from e j
plum attorney both times
i wouldve guessed otis had an iq of minus ten sandy said with a smile
go on to the next heir the judge replied
deere  d denton deere
age 25
graduate of uw medical school
firstyear intern plastic surgery
parents live in racine not heirs
westing connection engaged to angela wexler see wexlers who looks like sam westings daughter violet who was also engaged to be married but to a politician not an intern
thats awful complicated i know the doorman apologized but its the best i could do  pulaski  sydelle pulaski
age 50
education  high school one year secretarial school
secretary to the president of schultz sausages
is taking her first vacation in 25 years six months savedup time
lived with widowed mother and two aunts until she moved to sunset towers
walked with a crutch even before she broke her ankle in the second bombing
now needs two crutches she paints them
westing connection 
we dont have any medical reports on her muscular ailment sandy reported
the nurse at schultz sausages said she was in perfect health when she left on vacation strange the judge remarked
a suspicious malady no apparent westing connection somehow sydelle pulaski did not seem to fit in
sydelle pulaski clasped the translated notes to her bosom
my little secret mustnt peek she said coyly but the doctors had come to see angela
the plastic surgeon loosed the tape from her cheek and peered under the gauze
one graft should do it but we cant operate until the tissue heals he said to the intern then spoke to the patient
call my secretary for an appointment in two  months he strode out of the room leaving denton deere to replace the bandage
i dont want plastic surgery angela mumbled
it still hurt to talk
nothing to be frightened of
hes the best when it comes to facial repairs thats why i brought him in well have to postpone the wedding we can have a small informal wedding mother wouldnt like that how about you angela what do you want he knew her unspoken answer was i dont know the door flew open and slammed against the adjacent wall
where do you think youre going denton pulled turtle to a halt by one of the streaming ribbons twisted in her braid
the sign says no visitors im not a visitor im a sister
and get your germy hands off my hair denton deere hurried to seek first aid for his bleeding shin and sent the biggest male nurse on the floor to take care of turtle the same male nurse who chased otis amber out of the hospital for sneaking up on a nurses aide carrying a specimen tray and shouting boom turtle had time for one question
angela what did you sign on the receipt this time after position person i changed mine to victim sydelle said
turtle paid no attention to the victim
she was more interested in the two men entering the room the burly male nurse and that creep of a lawyer plum
i gotta go
dont say anything to anybody about anything angela no matter what  happens
not even to a lawyer
you know nothing you hear
nothing she skirted ed plum ducked under the outstretched hairy hands of the male nurse slid down the hall scampered down the stairs and out of the hospital
hi how are you ed plum smiled at angela ignoring the patient in the other bed
he didnt recognize ms pulaski without her painted crutch
im sorry to hear about your accident
otis amber told me about it
just thought id drop in for a chat the young lawyer who had admired the pretty heiress from the minute he first laid eyes on her did not have a chance to chat
grace wexler entered the room saw the answer to the clues ed purplefruit the murderer standing over her daughter and uttered a bloodcurdling shriek
three visitors in one day
the first was otis amber with a letter and another receipt to sign
chris had pretended to be scared by the boom but he wasnt really
he had twitched because he was excited about going to the westing house again even if he hadnt figured out the clues
then flora baumbach came to see him
he wasnt nervous at all with that nice lady
she smiles that funny smile because shes sad inside
she once had a daughter named rosalie
she told him how rosalie would sit in the shop and say hello to the customers and how she would feel the fabrics
mrs baumbach made wedding dresses which are mostly white so she bought samples of materials with bright colors and patterns because rosalie loved colors best
rosalie had 573 different swatches in her collection before she died
mrs  baumbach said her daughter might have been an artist if things had turned out differently
what would i have been if things had turned out differently
the third visitor entered
limping
his partner was limping
too much excitement his stupid body was jerking all over the place
denton deere sat down next to the wheelchair
take it easy chris
calm down kid im not the creature from the black lagoon you know his partner a doctor watched horror movies on television too
slowly arms untangled legs unsnarled
slowly chris stuttered out his news flora baumbach felt so guilty about seeing their dropped clue that she told him one of her clues mountain
but we mmusn ttell tturtle dont worry the intern said displaying a bruised shin
chris laughed then stopped
i ssorry mountain hmmm denton deere thought about the new clue
if a treasure is hidden in a grain shed on a mountain plain i sure dont have time to look for it
do you nnn lets forget the clues i have something more important to tell you
dont get excited okay chris nodded
his partner was going to ask for the money
denton deere stood
ill get your toothbrush and pajamas then well go to the hospital
dont get excited chris got excited
how could he explain that what he wanted from his partner was companionship not more probing pricking doctors with their bad news that made his mother cry
listen chris can you hear me
just overnight
i found a neurologist a nerve doctor who works on problems like yours oppprashn no operation
did you hear me chris
no operation
the doctor thinks a new medicine may help but he has to examine you make some tests
i have your parents permission but no one will touch you unless we talk it over first you and me together
i promise chris grimaced trying to smile
his partner said talk it over the two of them together
they were really partners now
you cccn have mmoney what
oh the money
later
here let me take those you wont need them in the hospital chris clung to his binoculars
well i guess you do need them
ready
here we go all of a sudden he was leaving sunset towers pushed by his limping partner
maybe doctor deere is not who and what he says he is
maybe he is being kidnapped for ransom
maybe hes being held hostage
oh boy he hasnt had so much fun in years
19  odd relatives  thursday was a sunny day a glorious day the autumn air was crisp and clear
none of the heirs noticed
wpp crossed the tape at 44…44½…46
fortysix dollars a share
oh my
dont sell until i give the word baba aliceturtle had said
baba
the dressmaker smiled at her new name and eased back in the chair but not for long
wpp 48¼
oh my oh my
flora baumbach bit her thumbnail to the quick
if only the child was here
the child was being examined by the school nurse having been caught again with a radio plugged in her ear
turtle blamed her misbehavior on a toothache
the only thing that soothes the horrendous pain is listening to music you should see a dentist the nurse said
i have an appointment next week turtle lied
can i go home now
the pain is truly unbearable no the nurse packed the tooth with foultasting cotton and sent her back to class
so every half hour turtle had to ask permission to go to the lavatory in order to keep up with the latest stock market reports
bladder infection she explained
crow polished mrs wexlers silver teapot with a westing disposable diaper for the third time
two more days the day after next
it was too painful going back to that house but otis said she must to collect her due
it was her penance to go back not her due
blessed is he who expects nothing
boom
just a warning to keep doors locked the delivery boy said dumping a carton of westing paper products on the kitchen floor
you know crow old pal i think i figured out who the bomber is crow stiffened as she stared at her distorted reflection in the shining silver
who  thats right otis amber said
james shin hoo
he wanted to put the coffee shop out of business right
then he had to bomb his own restaurant so nobody would suspect him right
and he catered the wexler party
nobody would notice if the caterer brought in an extra box along with the food right james shin hoo was the bomber
crows hands trembled her face blotched with hate
that beautiful innocent angel reborn sandy said her face will be scarred for life
james shin hoo beware
vengeance shall be mine
the judge rearranged her docket in order to have these last days free
leave it to sam westing to interfere with her work
sandy turned to his next entry
its an interesting one crow  berthe erica crow
age 57
mother  died at childbirth raised by father deceased
education 1 year of high school
married at 16 divorced at 40
exhusbands name windy windkloppel
hospital records problems related to chronic alcoholism

gave up drinking when she took up religion
started the good salvation soup kitchen on skid row
works as  cleaning woman in sunset towers lives in maids apartment on fourth floor
westing connection 
yes it is interesting judge ford replied but it hardly tells us what we want to know youve got a customer jake wexler pointed a sparerib at the blackclad figure standing at the restaurant door
must be a bill collector hoo said frowning over his account book
grace looked up saw it was only the cleaning woman and returned to the sports photographs she was sorting
a dozen or more superstars would be framed and hung on one wall of hoos on first
come on over and join us jake shouted
limping to their table crow heard mrs wexler click her tongue
sinful woman shell go to hell with her pride and her covetousness and take that footbutcher of a husband with her
and that one the fat one the glutton the bomber the mutilator of innocent children
maybe she is a customer hoo thought recognizing the face clenched in righteous anger as that of a diner not being served fast enough
he rose and pulled out a chair for crow
my wife will be serving a chinese tea lunch shortly madame hoo placed a variety of dumplings on the table giggled at jake and ran back to the kitchen
that tittering madame hoo was a beautiful woman
and quite young
grace casting a suspicious eye on her husband  was suddenly seized by a surge of gnawing jealousy maybe it was just the fried dumpling
madame hoo returned to pour the tea
jake patted her hand
good grace noticed shes clutching her stomach about time she felt jealous
the podiatrist turned his smile to crow
nothing wrong with your appetite im happy to see nothing is wrong with my mouth the cleaning woman replied looking down at her plate its my feet that hurt
that corn you cut out didnt heal yet i got a callus on the sole of my left foot and my ingrown toenail is growing in again grace clasped a hand over her mouth and ran out of the restaurant
mr hoo headed for the kitchen
your trouble comes from years of wearing the wrong kind of shoes jake lectured
crow wasnt listening
james shin hoo the bomber was coming back
he had something in his hand
here crow try these
i invented them myself
paper innersoles
theyll make you feel like youre floating on air
its tough standing on your feet all day
here take them crow examined the two pads of spongy folded paper
how much nothing compliments of the house still suspicious crow slipped the innersoles into her shoes and tried walking
what a blessed relief
otis amber was wrong
james shin hoo was a charitable man he couldnt be the bomber
crow floated out of the restaurant without paying for her lunch
oh no not another victim sydelle pulaski cried stuffing her notes under the mattress
the nurse wheeled chris next to angelas bed and explained that the boy was being tested for a new medication
are you all right she asked bending over the squirming patient
chris was trying to remove a blank sealed envelope from his bathrobe pocket
he knew his brother had a crush on angela
he figured theo must have sneaked upstairs in the wrong bathrobe to slip this letter under angelas door then remembered she was in the hospital and was too shy to give it to her in person
look at that smile sydelle exclaimed
ffrom theo he said
chris hoped to watch angela read the love letter but the nurse insisted he return to his room
byebye good luck sydelle called
angela waved a bandaged hand
mmounttain chris replied
from tturtle serves her right for kicking his partner
mountain angela thought
turtles mt stood for mountain not empty
and the letter was not from theo your love has 2 here are 2 for you
take her away from this sin and hate now
before it is too late
again two clues were taped at the bottom with  majesties  crow and otis ambers clues are not king and queen she told sydelle
they are with thy beautiful majesties   sandy and the judge were still at work on the heirs

angela looks like violet westing so does grace in a way except shes older
sandy fidgeted with his pen
theres something i didnt write down
maybe i shouldnt tell you you being a judge and all but well jake wexler…hes a bookie no he should not have told her
a smalltime operator im sure mr mcsouthers the judge replied coldly
it can have no bearing on the matter before us
sam westing manipulated people cheated workers bribed officials stole ideas but sam westing never smoked or drank or placed a bet
give me a bookie any day over such a fine upstanding cleanliving man the doormans face reddened
he pulled the dented flask from his hip pocket and downed several swigs
she had been too harsh
would you like me to fix you a drink mr mcsouthers no thanks judge
i prefer my good old scotch windkloppel the judges outburst was so unexpected sandy had a hard time keeping down the last swig
grace wexlers maiden name is not windsor its windkloppel the judge exclaimed riffling through the pages of sandys notebook
here it is berthe erica crow
exhusbands name windy windkloppel sandy stopped coughing started laughing
grace windsor wexler is related to somebody all right shes related to the cleaning woman
think she knows judge i doubt it
besides we cannot be certain of the relationship
id like to see the documents in crows folder again im sure its windkloppel judge i checked all my spellings three times over  judge ford reread the private investigators reports
mr
mcsouthers it is windkloppel but look carefully at the name of the woman in this interview berthe erica crow
sure i knew her
she and her pa lived in the upstairs flat
we were best friends almost like sisters but she was the pretty one with her beautiful complexion and long goldred hair
she left school to marry a guy named windkloppel
havent seen or heard from her since
shes not in any trouble is she
transcript of a taped interview with sybil pulaski november 12
pulaski the doorman said
not just pulaski the judge pointed out
sybil pulaski
sam westing wanted crows childhood friend sybil pulaski to be one of his heirs
he got sydelle pulaski instead gee judge i never noticed that boy am i dumb
but what does it mean what it means mr mcsouthers is that sam westing made his first mistake  20  confessions  friday came quickly to the westing heirs
too quickly
time was running out
turtle skipped school
she was in trouble enough but she could build her own school and hire her own kind of teachers once she became a millionaire
in spite of having turtle at her side flora baumbach still stared at the everchanging endless tape from the edge of the chair chewed what remained of her fingernails and uttered an oh my each time wpp went by
at two oclock westing paper products sold at fiftytwo dollars a share its highest price in fifteen years
now baba
sell doug hoo had a legitimate excuse from classes tomorrow was the big track meet
he jogged he sprinted he ran at full speednot on the track but on the trail of otis amber
back and forth from the shopping center to sunset towers again and again and again and…hey this is a new direction
otis amber parked his delivery bike in front of a rooming house and went inside
doug waited hidden in a doorway across the street
and waited
people came and went but no otis amber
doug jogged up and down the block for two hours
still no sign of otis amber
doug was cold and hungry but at least his feet didnt hurt anymore
last night when he asked doc wexler about the blisters the podiatrist told him to see his fatherhis father of all people
but those paper innersoles really worked
at five oclock otis amber skipped out of the rooming house hopped on his bicycle and returned to sunset towers emptyhanded
dougs assignment was over well almost over
where was theo
theo was being patched up in the hospital emergency room after a slight miscalculation in his solution experiment
fortunately no one else was around when the lab blew up
you like playing with explosives kid the bomb squad detective asked
accidents in highschool chemistry were not unusual but this student lived in sunset towers
i was experimenting on chemical fertilizers theo replied wincing as the doctor probed his shoulder for a glass shard
the first bomb went off in your folks coffee shop right
your mother and father work you pretty hard dont they they work harder than i do
why all the questions
your captain said the sunset towers explosions were just fireworks sure they were but bombers have a funny habit of going in for bigger and bigger bangs
until they get caught theo had an alibi
he was nowhere near the wexler apartment the day the third bomb went off
the detective grunted a warning about careless chemistry but theo had already learned his lesson
ouch at last the coffee shop owner himself delivered the up order
the judge came right to the point
mr
theodorakis tell me about your relationship with violet westing
i have reason to believe a life is in danger or i would not ask it was a question he had expected
i grew up in westingtown where my father was a factory foreman
violet westing and i were what youd call childhood sweethearts
we planned to get married someday when i could afford it but  her mother broke us up
she wanted violet to marry somebody important the judge had to interrupt
her mother
are you saying it was mrs westing who arranged the marriage not sam westing george theodorakis nodded
thats right
sam westing tried to involve violet in his business
i guess he hoped shed take over the paper company one day but she had her heart set on being a teacher
besides violet didnt have much of a business sense
after that her father never paid her much attention go on the judge held the witness in her stare
the subject was becoming painful and mr theodorakis faltered several times in the telling
mrs
westing handpicked that politicianprobably figured the guy would end up in the white house and her daughter would be first lady
but violet thought he was nothing but a cheap political hack a cheap crook
violet was a gentle person an only child
she couldnt turn against her mother she couldnt face marrying that guy… i guess she couldnt find any way out except… mrs westing sort of went off her rocker after violets death and i… well it was a long time ago thank you mr theodorakis the judge said ending the interrogation
the man had a different life now different loves different problems
thank you you have been a big help sandy was now able to complete the entry  theodorakis  theo theodorakis
age 17
high  school senior
works in family coffee shop
wants to be a writer
seems lonely cant find anyone to play chess with
christos theodorakis
age 15
younger brother of above
confined to wheelchair disease struck about four years ago
knows a lot about birds
westing connection father was childhood sweetheart of sam westings daughter who looked like angela wexler
mrs westing broke up the affair
she wanted daughter to marry somebody else but violet westing killed herself before the wedding
neither parents of above are heirs
i hear the new medicine theyre trying out on chris is doing some good sandy reported
but the poor kid needs more help than medicine
hes real smart you know
chris could have a real future be a scientist or a professor even but it will take a pile of money more money than his folks could ever make to put him through college with a handicap like that the parents interest me more the judge said
why are they not heirs sandy had some thoughts on that too
maybe sam westing didnt want to embarrass george theodorakis him being married and all
or maybe westing figured hed be too  busy with his coffee shop to stay in the game
or maybe westing blamed him for his daughters death figuring they should have eloped no if sam westing blamed mr theodorakis he would have made him an heir in this miserable game the judge replied
there are too many maybes here which is what sam westing planned
we must not allow ourselves to be distracted from the real issue which heir did sam westing want punished the person who hurt him most sandy guessed
and who would that be the person who caused his daughters death exactly mr mcsouthers
sam westing plotted against the person he held responsible for his daughters suicide the person who forced violet westing to marry a man she loathed mrs
westing
but thats not possible judge
mrs westing is not one of the heirs i think she is mr mcsouthers
the former wife of sam westing must be one of the heirs
mrs westing is the answer and whoever she is she is the one we have to protect  21  the fourth bomb  the door to apartment 2c opened
flora baumbach screamed and turtle flung herself on the pile of money they had been counting
it was theo not the thief
can i borrow your bike for a few hours
its very important theo was not a runner like doug who was fuming about his being so late
he needed the bicycle to follow otis amber right now
turtle stared at him in stony silence
i didnt make that sign in the elevator besides you already kicked me for it
please turtle she still wouldnt answer punk kid
i had a long talk with the police today but i refused to tell them who the bomber was whats that supposed to mean what does she think it means
it means that he and everybody else knows that turtle is the bomber
never mind
can i have your bike or not why do you want it theo ground his teeth
take it easy anger wont help any more than blackmail did
try being a good guy
i saw angela in the hospital today
she sends her regards whats that supposed to mean you let me have that bike turtle wexler oror else turtle did not have to ask what or else meant police bomberangela but how did theo find out
here she threw the padlock key across the room and waited for him to rush out before she let go of the money
hes such a nice boy flora baumbach remarked
sure turtle replied dialing the telephone number of the hospital
angela wexler room 325 room 325 is not accepting any calls turtle hung up the phone
if theo knew others knew
angela had set off those fireworks wanting to get caught but it was different now
now she was confused now she was just  plain scared
they could force a confession out of her in no time the guilt was right there staring out of those big blue eyes
maybe theyre questioning her now
baba im not feeling so good i think ill go home to bed weaving through rush hour traffic on turtles bike theo trailed the bus to a seamy downtown district across the railroad tracks where crow and otis got off
skid row
the pair wandered through the dimly lit littered and stinking street bending over grimy bums asleep in doorways raising them to their unsteady feet and leading the ragtag procession into a decaying storefront
paint was peeling off the letters on the window good salvation soup kitchen
a drunken wreck of a man lurched into theo who put a quarter into the filthy outstretched hand more out of fright than charity
snatches of hymnsinging drifted toward him as the last of the stragglers staggered through the door
theo crossed the narrow street and pressed his nose against the steamy soupkitchen window
rows of wretched souls sat hunched on wooden benches
crow stood before them in her neat black dress her hands raised toward the crumbling ceiling
behind her otis amber stirred a boiling mess in a big iron pot
theo pedaled back to sunset towers at a furious pace
whatever brought crow and otis amber to these lower depths was none of his business
he hated himself for spying
he hated sam westing and his dirty money and his dirty game
theo felt as dirty as the derelicts he spied on
dirtier
  the judge thought they had finished with the heirs
not quite the doorman said
mcsouthers  called sandy
age 65
born edinburgh scotland
immigrated to wisconsin age 3
education eighth grade
jobs mill worker union organizer prizefighter doorman
married six children two grandchildren
westing connection worked in westing paper plant 20 years
fired by sam westing himself for trying to organize the workers
no pension
alexander  mcsouthers
sandy turned to a blank page pushed his taped glasses up the broken bridge of his nose and looked at the judge
name it had not seemed sporting to investigate ones own partner but mcsouthers was right this was a westing game
of course she had kept some facts from him about the other heirs but only because she did not trust his blabbering
josiejo ford with a hyphen between josie and jo age fortytwo
education columbia law degree harvard the judge waited for the doorman to enter the information in his slow cramped lettering
he had to be meticulous in order to prove he was better than his eighthgrade education
its a pity he had not gone further he was quite a clever man
jobs assistant district attorney
judge family court state supreme court appellate division
appellate has two ps and two ls
never married no children westing connection the judge paused then spoke so rapidly sandy had to stop taking notes
my mother was a servant in the westing household my father worked for the railroad and was the gardener on his days off you mean you lived in the westing house sandy asked with obvious surprise
you knew the westings i barely saw mrs westing
violet was a few years younger than i dolllike and delicate
she was not allowed to play with other children
especially the skinny longlegged black daughter of the servants gee you must have been lonely judge having nobody to play with i played with sam westingchess
hour after hour i sat staring down at that chessboard
he lectured me he insulted me and he won every game the judge thought of their last game she had been so excited about taking his queen only to have the master checkmate her in the next move
sam westing had deliberately sacrificed his queen and she had fallen for it
stupid child you cant have a brain in that frizzy head to make a move like that those were the last words he ever said to her
the judge continued i was sent to boarding school when i was twelve
my parents visited me at school when they could but i never set foot in the westing house again not until two weeks ago  your folks must have really worked hard sandy said
an education like that costs a fortune sam westing paid for my education
he saw that i was accepted into the best schools probably arranged for my first job perhaps more i dont know thats the first decent thing ive heard about the old man hardly decent mr mcsouthers
it was to sam westings advantage to have a judge in his debt
needless to say i have excused myself from every case remotely connected with westing affairs youre awfully hard on yourself judge
and on him
maybe westing paid for your education cause you were smart and needy and you did all the rest by yourself this is getting us nowhere mr mcsouthers
just write westing connection education financed by sam westing
debt never repaid theo upset over his skid row snooping took out his anger on the up button poking it jabbing it until the elevator finally made its way down to the lobby
slowly the door slid open
he stared down at the sparking sputtering arsenal yelled and bellyflopped to the carpet as rockets whizzed out of the elevator inches above his head
boom
boom
a blinding flash of white fire streaked through the lobby through the open entrance door and burst into a chrysanthemum of color in the night sky
then the elevator door closed
the bomber had made one mistake
the last rocket blasted off when the elevator returned to the third floor
boom
by the time the bomb squad reached the scene by way of the stairs the smoke had cleared but the young girl was still huddled on the hallway floor tears streaming down her turtlelike face
for heavens sake say something her mother said
tell me where it hurts the pain was too great to be put into words
five inches of turtles braid were badly singed
grace wexler attacked the policeman
nothing but a childish prank you said
some childish prank both my children cruelly injured almost killed
maybe now youll do something now that its too late unshaken by the mothers anger the policeman held up the sign that had been taped to the elevator wall the bomber strikes again
on the reverse side was a handwritten composition how i spent my summer vacation by turtle wexler
grace grabbed the theme and shook it at her daughter who was being rocked in flora baumbachs arms
somebody stole this from you didnt they turtle
you couldnt have done such an awful thing not to angela not to your own sister could you turtle
could you i want to see a lawyer turtle replied
the bomb squad faced with six hours overtime filling out forms and delivering the delinquent to a juvenile detention facility decided it was best for all concerned to escort the  prisoner to apartment 4d and place her in the custody of judge ford
judge ford put on her black robe and seated herself behind the desk
before her stood a downcast child looking very sad and very sorry
not at all like the turtle she knew
you surprise me turtle wexler
i thought you were too smart to commit such a dangerous destructive and stupid act yes maam why did you do it turtle
to hurt someone to get even with someone no maam of course not
turtle kicked shins she was not the type to bottle up her anger
you do understand that a child would not receive as harsh a penalty as an adult would
that there would be no permanent criminal record yes maam
i mean no maam she was protecting someone
she had set off the fireworks in the elevator to divert suspicion from the real bomber
but who was the real bomber
nothing to do but drag it out of her name by name starting with the least likely
are you protecting angela no the judge was astounded by the excited response
angela could not be the bomber not that sweet pretty thing
thing
is that how she regarded that young woman as a thing
and what had she ever said to her except i hear youre getting married angela or how pretty you look angela had anyone asked about her ideas her hopes her plans
if i had been treated like that id have used dynamite not fireworks no i would have just walked out and kept right on going
but  angela was different
what a senseless thing to do the judge said aloud
yes maam turtle stared down at the carpet wondering if she had given angela away
judge ford rose and placed an arm around turtles bony shoulders
she had never wished for a sister until this moment
turtle will you give me your word that you will never play with fireworks again yes maam while were at it do you have anything else to confess yes maam
i was in the westing house the night mr westing died good lord child sit down and tell me turtle began with the purplewaves story went on to the whisperings the beddeddown corpse the dropped peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and her mothers cross and ended with the twentyfour dollars she had won
did either you or doug hoo call the police no maam we were too scared we just ran
is that a crime the judge said it was a criminal offense to conceal a murder
but mr westing didnt look murdered turtle argued
he looked asleep like he did in the coffin
he looked like a wax dummy a wax dummy now turtle was the one surprised by the excited response
the judge thinks it might have been a real wax dummy not a corpse at all
then what happened to sam westing
the judge regained her composure
not reporting a dead body is a violation of the health code but i wouldnt worry about it
is there anything else turtle yes maam turtle replied glancing at the portable bar
could i have a little bourbon what just a little
on a piece of cotton to put in my cavity
my tooth hurts something awful relieved at not having a juvenile alcoholic on her hands judge ford prepared the home remedy
is that better
good
you may go home now home meant going to baba
baba loved her no matter what and turtle didnt care if the others thought she was the bomberexcept sandy
he was walking toward her right now walking his bouncy walk but not smiling
sandy is disappointed in her he thinks she hurt her own sister he doesnt want to be friends anymore
hows my girl sandy said cupping his hand under her chin and lifting her head
whew
hitting the bottle again its just bourbon on cotton for my toothache yeah ive heard that one before honest saaaneee turtle was pointing inside her wideopen mouth
the doorman peered in
wow thats some cavity it looks like the grand canyon
tomorrow morning youre going to see my dentistno back talk
hes very gentle you wont feel a thing
promise youll go turtle nodded
sandy smiled
good then down to business
my wifes having a birthday tomorrow
i thought one of your gorgeous striped candles would make a swell present theres only one candle left turtle replied
its the best of the lot
six super colors
i spent a lot of time making it thats why i wouldnt part with it
but since its for your wifes birthday sandy ill let you have it for only five dollars
and i wont charge you sales tax try not to stick your fanny out so far angela said from her chair
now that sydelle pulaski depended on crutches she lurched clumsily hobbled by old habits
just keep reading those clues the secretary straightened shoulders back stomach in until her next step
with their telephone switched off and contagious disease added to the no visitors sign the bomb victims had privacy at last
sydelle had twice read the entire will aloud
now angela her hands unbandaged was reshuffling the collected clues
with  grains spacious grace good hood beautiful majesties from thy purple waves onno mountain  again sydelle ordered
change them around and read either the word on or the word no both together are confusing good spacious grains with grace on thy purple mountain hood waves from majesties beautiful  shh someone was at the door
angela picked up the note that was slipped underneath
my darling angela i guess the sign on the door means i should stay away too
i understand
we both need time to think things over
ill wait
i love youdenton what does it say what does it say sydelle pressed but angela read only the postscript aloud ps
you have another admirer
chris wants to give you and ms pulaski one of our clues
flora baumbach has seen it too
the word is plain
like an airplane sydelle asked
no plain like ordinary
like the wide open plains plains grains
quick angela read the clues again good hood from spacious plain grains on with with beautiful waves grace thy purple mountain majesties  thats it angela
we got it we got it sydelle could barely control her excitement
the will said sing in praise of this generous land
the will said may god thy gold refine
america angela america
purple mountain majesties angela
whoopee  fortunately sydelle pulaski was close to the bed when she threw her crutches in the air
22  losers winners  saturday morning a new message was posted in the elevator i turtle wexler confess to those four bombs
im sorry it was a dumb thing to do and i wont do it again
but
i am not the burglar and i never murdered anybody ever
your friend turtle ps
to make up for scaring you i will treat everybody here to an exquisite chinese cuisine dinner when i win the inheritance
poor grace mr hoo said
one daughter almost killed the other one a bomber
smartaleck kid first she blows up my kitchen then she advertises my cuisine
win the inheritance ha
maybe im lucky my son is a dumb jock boom madame hoo said happily
she knew where they were going
always on the day when doug ate six eggs for breakfast he ran around and around a big track and people  clapped and gave him a shiny medal
doug was so proud of his medals
she would never take them not even the gold one not even if it took her two more years to pay to go back to china
no she would never take dougs medals and she would never sell that wonderful clock with the mouse who wears gloves and points to the time
you must be out of your mind jake wexler
go to a track meet with all those people pointing at me snickering saying look there she is the mother of cain and abel im not even sure i have the nerve to show my face at the westing house tonight come on grace itll do you good the podiatrist urged his reluctant wife down the third floor hall
stop thinking about yourself for a change think how poor turtle must feel dont ever mention that child to me again not after what she did to angela
i never told you this jake but ive always had a sinking sensation that the hospital mixed up the babies when turtle was born its no wonder she wanted to blow us all up graces despair exploded in anger
oh i get it youre putting the blame on me
if you had given her a good talking to about kicking people when i asked she might not have ended up a common criminal whatever became of that funloving woman i married what was her namegracie windkloppel grace quickly looked around to see if anyone had overheard that ugly name but they were in the elevator alone
oh i know what people think she complained
poor jake wexler good guy everybodys friend married to that uppity  wouldbe decorator
well angelas not going to have to scrimp and save to make ends meet shes going to marry a real doctor
ill see to that sure you will grace youll see that angela doesnt marry a loser like her father a real doctor she says
a podiatrist is a real doctorwell it is these days but when he went to school it was different
he could have gone back taken more courses but he was married by then a fatheroh whos he kidding gracies right he is a loser
next shell mention having to give up her family because she married a jewno she never brings that up grace with all her faults would never do that
the elevator door opened to the lobby
grace turned to her silent sadeyed husband the loser
oh jake whats happening to us
whats happening to me
maybe theyre right maybe im not a nice person jake pressed the close door button and took his sobbing wife into his arms
its all right gracie were going home the doors opened on the second floor
mom
whats the matter with her daddy shes crying
gee mom im sorry it was just a few fireworks if her mother ever found out who the real bomber was shed really go to pieces
turtle looked even more like a turtle today with her sad little face peering out of the kerchief tied under her small chin
let go of the door turtle jake said
and have a good time at the track meet
you too mrs baumbach track meet
they werent going to a track meet
and they sure were not going to have a good time
grace was still sobbing on jakes shoulder as he led her into their apartment
mother whats the matter
whats wrong with her dad nothing angela your mothers just having a good cry
why dont you and ms pulaski leave us alone for a while come angela sydelle said prodding her with the tip of one of her mismatched crutches
we have some painting to do angela looked back at the embracing couple her fathers face was buried in her weeping mothers tousled hair
they had not asked how she got home from the hospital by taxi they had not asked if she was still in pain not much they had not even peeked under the bandage to see if a scar was forming on her cheek there was
angela was on her own
well thats what she wanted wasnt it
yes yes it was
she uttered a short laugh and her hand flew up to the pain in her face
do i look funny or something no i wasnt laughing at you sydelle id never laugh at you
its just that suddenly everything seemed all right its all right all right her partner replied unlocking the four locks on her apartment door
tonights the night were going to win it all were they
the will said look for a name
they had a song not a name
o beautiful for spacious skies sydelle began to sing for purple waves of grain not purple angela corrected her amber
for amber waves of grain amber
judge ford paced the floor
tonight sam westing would wreak his revenge unless she could prevent it
if she was right the person in danger was the former mrs westing
and if turtle was right about the wax dummy sam westing himself might be there to watch the fun
there was a knock on her door
the judge was surprised to see denton deere even more surprised when he wheeled chris theodorakis into her apartment
hello judge
everybody else in the building is going to the track meet it seems
i passed sandy on the way out and he said you wouldnt mind having chris for part of the afternoon
ive got to get back to the hospital hello judge fford chris held out a steady hand which the judge shook
youre looking well chris the mmedicine helped a lot its a big step forward the intern said
wrong word the kid may never leave that wheelchair
an even more effective medication is now in the developmental stage that really sounded pompous
well so long chris
see you tonight
thanks judge he knows lots of bbig words chris said
yes he certainly does judge ford replied
what was she going to do with this boy here
she had so much to think about so much to plan
you ccan work ill birdwatch chris offered wheeling to the window his binoculars banging against his thin chest
good idea the judge returned to her desk to study the newspaper clippings
mrs westing a tall thin woman
she may no longer be thin but she would still be tall
about sixty years old
if sam westings former wife was one of the heirs she had to be crow
look chris shouted startling the judge into dropping her files to the floor
she rushed to his side thinking he needed help
look up there judge
isnt it bbeautiful high in the fall sky a v of geese was flying south
yes it was a beautiful sight
those are geese the judge explained
ccanada goose branta ccanadensis chris replied
the judge was impressed but she had work to do
stooping to gather the dropped clippings she was confronted by the face of sam westing
the photograph had been taken fifteen years ago
those piercing eyes the vandyke beard that short beaked nose like a turtles
the wax dummy in the coffin had been molded in the former image of sam westing as he had looked fifteen years agonot as he looked now
she searched the folder
no recent photographs no hospital records no death certificate just the accident report from the state highway police dr sidney sikes suffered a crushed leg and samuel w westing had severe facial injuries
facial injuries
it was the face that had disappeared fifteen years ago not the man
westing had a different face a face remodeled by plastic surgery
a different face and a different name
now what
her gaze rested on her charge at the window
feeling her eyes chris turned around
the boy has a nice smile
i hope you are better at filling cavities than making false teeth turtle said gripping the arms of the dentists chair
in a glass cabinet against the wall three rows of dentures grinned at her with crooked teeth overlapping teeth notched teeth
those faults are what makes the dentures look real the dentist explained
nothing in nature is quite perfect you know
now open your mouth wide
wider ow turtle screamed before the probe touched tooth
just relax young lady ill tell you when to say ow turtle tried to think about other things
false teeth buckteeththat rotten bucktoothed barney northrup stopped by this morning to tell the wexlers they would have to pay for all the damage done by the bombs
barney northrup had called her parents irresponsible and had called her something worse much worse
he sure was surprised by that kick it was her hardest one ever
now you can say ow the dentist unclipped the towel from her shoulder
turtle passed her tongue over the drilled tooth
she had not felt a thing but the real pain was yet to come
flora baumbach was taking her to the beauty parlor to have her singed hair cut off
college teams from five states competed in the first indoor track meet of the season but the big event the mile run was won by a highschool senior
thats my boy thats my doug mr hoo shouted one voice among thousands cheering the youngster on his victory lap
cameras flashed as doug posed smiling broadly index fingers high in the air
i owe it all to my dad he told reporters and cameras flashed again as doug flung an arm around the proud mr hoo
just wait until the next olympics the inventor thought
with dougs feet and my innersoles hell run them all to the ground
later that evening madame hoo chattering in unintelligible chinese made it known that she wanted doug to wear his prize to the westing house
standing on tiptoe she placed the ribbon over his bent head and patted the shiny gold medal in place on his chest
good boy she said in english
a saddened sandy returned to apartment 4d
hi chris
did you talk to him judge talk to whom barney northrup
he was waiting at the front door when i got back from the track meet mad as a wet cat
said he had lots of complaints about menever being on duty drinking on the joblies like that
he fired me right on the spot
i told him you wanted to see him figuring you might put in a good word so hed let me stay on no mr mcsouthers im sorry but i havent seen barney northrup since i rented this apartment barney northrup was that westings disguise false buckteeth slick black wig pastedon moustache well its not the first time i got fired for no cause the dejected doorman blew his nose loudly in a westing mansized hankie
hey chris bet you dont know the latin name of the redheaded woodpecker  that was a hard one
chris had to say melanerpes erythrocephalus very slowly
some smart kid hey judge
chris the judge and i have a little business to discuss
excuse us for a minute judge ford joined the doorman in the kitchen
our game plan is this mr mcsouthers
we give no answer
no answer at all
our duty is to protect westings exwife crow sandy guessed
thats right theres something else thats been bothering me judge
i know it sounds crazy but well i found out otis amber doesnt live in the grocers basement and hes not as dumb as he pretends
hes a snoop and a troublemaker and i dont think he is who he says he is and who do you think otis amber is the judge asked
sam westing judge ford leaned against the sink and pressed her head against the cabinet
if sandy was correct she had played right into the mans handssam westings hands
cmon crow you always like to get there early to open the door for people crow had stopped in the middle of the steep road to stare up at the westing house
ive got a funny feeling that something evil is waiting for me up there otis
its a bad house full of misery and sin
hes still there you know sam westing is dead and buried
come on if we dont go we gotta give the money back and we already spent it on the soup kitchen  i feel his presence otis
hes looking for a murderer violets murderer stop scaring yourself with crazy notions you sound like youre on the bottle again crow strode ahead
i didnt mean that crow honest
look up there at that moon
isnt it romantic somebodys in real danger otis and i think its me  23  strange answers  lawyer plum was there and one pair of heirs when otis amber danced into the game room
hehehe the turtles lost its tail i see turtle slumped low in her chair
flora baumbach thought the short sleek haircut was adorable especially the way it swept forward over her little chin but turtle did not want to look adorable
she wanted to look mean
the dressmaker fumbled past the wad of money in her handbag
here alice i thought you might like to see this turtle glanced at the old snapshot
its baba all right except younger
same dumb smile
suddenly she sat upright
thats my daughter rosalie flora baumbach said
she must have been nine or ten when that picture was taken rosalie was squat and square and squinty her protruding tongue was too large for her mouth her head lolled to one side
i think i would have liked her baba turtle said
rosalie looks like she was a very happy person
she must have been nice to have around thumpthump thumpthump
here come the victims sydelle pulaski announced
angela greeted her sister with a wave of her crimsonstreaked healing hand
turtle had convinced her not to confess it would mean a criminal record it would kill their mother and no one would believe her anyhow
i like your haircut thanks turtle replied
now angela had to love her forever
most of the heirs had to comment on turtles hair
you look like a real businesswoman sandy said
well thats an improvement denton deere said
you look nnice chris said
only theo bent over the chessboard said nothing
white had moved the kings bishop since the last meeting
it was his move
at last the stares turned from turtles hair to a more surprising sight
judge ford strode in as regally as an african princess her noble head swathed in a turban her tall body draped in yards of handprinted cloth
she slipped a note to denton deere then sailed to her place at table four
goggleeyed otis amber was speechless they all were except for sandy
gee thats a nifty outfit judge
is that what you call ethnic the judge did not reply
applaud the local hero has arrived
doug raised his arms pointing his index fingers to the flaking gilt ceiling in the imnumberone sign and acknowledged the clapping with a victory lap around the room
here come the wexlers mr hoo remarked seating his puzzled wife at table one
turtle exchanged an anxious glance with angela
the last time they saw their mother she was crying her head off now the tears were gone from her bleary eyes but she was staggering giggling her hair was a mess
sorry were late jake apologized
we lost track of time they had been clinking wineglasses in a small cafe the cafe they used to go to before they were married toasting good times
they had had many good times together many good memories shared it seemsthree big wine bottles full
happy grace waved at the heirs
she felt so wonderful so overflowing with love for jake for everybody
hi mom turtle called
grace blinked at a young shorthaired girl
whos that jake greeted his partner with a how are you this fine day doug win replied madame hoo
having opened the door to the last of the heirs a tense and troubled crow took her seat next to otis amber
ghostthreatened she waited for the unseen
hey lawyer can we open these otis amber shouted waving an envelope
a similar envelope lay on each table
his forehead creased with uncertainty ed plum fumbled through his papers
i guess so was his opinion
cheers erupted as the heirs withdrew the checks
again judge ford signed her name to the tenthousanddollar check and handed it to the doorman
here you are mr mcsouthers this should tide you over until you find another job  sandys heartfelt thanks were muffled by sydelle pulaskis loud shhhh shhhhhhhh grace wexler mimicked then she dropped her head into her crossed arms on the table and fell asleep to the sound of the lawyers throatclearing coughs
twelfth  welcome again to the westing house
by now you have received a second check for ten thousand dollars
before the day is done you may have won more much more
table by table each pair will be called to give one and only one answer
the lawyer will record your response in case of a dispute
he does not know the answer
it is up to you
1   madame sun lin hoo cook jake wexler bookie  bookie
he really must have been distracted when he signed that receipt
jake studied the five clues on the table of  america  and  god  above  even knowing his wifes clues didnt help hed have to gamble on a long shot
say something he said to his partner
boom said madame hoo
ed plum wrote table one boom
2  flora baumbach dressmaker turtle wexler financier  turtle read a prepared statement in spite of the fact that the stock market dropped thirty points since we received our ten thousand dollars we have increased our capital to 1158750 an appreciation of twentyseven point eight percent calculated on an annual basis flora baumbach slapped a wad of bills on the table and two clinking quarters
in cash she said
ed plum asked them to repeat their answer
table twos answer is 1158750 sandy applauded
turtle took a bow
3   christos theodorakis  ornithologist denton deere intern  ornithologist
his brother must have given him that fancy title when he filled in the receipt
maybe he would become an ornithologist someday
he was a lucky person getting that medicine and all
he didnt want to accuse anybody not judge ford apartment 4d not otis grain amber not the limper just about everybody limped at one time or othertoday sandy was limping
i think mr westing is a ggood man chris said aloud
i think his last wish was to do ggood deeds
he ggave me a ppartner who helped me
he ggave everybody the pperfect ppartner to mmake friends what is table threes answer the lawyer asked
denton deere replied
our answer is mr westing was a good man 4   j j ford judge alexander mcsouthers fired  we dont have an answer the exdoorman responded as planned
the judge looked at table three
denton deere her note in his hand shook his head which meant no otis amber has not had plastic surgery done on his face
the judge turned to table six
otis amber could not be sam westing she was right to have trusted him
but crow is expecting something to happen
crow knows she is the answer she knows she is the one
5   gracie windkloppel wexler  restaurateur james hoo inventor  grace raised her head
did someone say windkloppel never mind windkloppel its our turn hoo snarled
the lawyer got names and positions all fouled up and ive got a drunk for a partner
he prodded grace to her feet
faces were swirling the floor was swaying
grace grabbed the edge of the floating table and gave her answer in a thick slurred voice
the newly decorated restaurant hoos on first the eatery of athletes will hold its grand reopening  on sunday
specialty of the day fruited sea bass on purple waves grace sat down where the chair wasnt
turtle gasped angela looked away the heirs tittered as jake helped his wife up from the floor
what is table fives answer please the lawyer pressed
ed plum said mr hoo
yes sir thats our answer ed plum oh 6   berthe erica crow mother otis amber deliverer  mother
did i write mother crow mumbled
is that your answer ed plum asked
i dont know otis amber replied
is mother our answer crow he could have sworn she had again signed the receipt good salvation soup kitchen
crow repeated mother and thats what the lawyer wrote down
7   douglas hoo champ theo theodorakis writer  their clues a chemical formula for an explosive and the letters otis doug basking in glory didnt care
theo stood turned to the man he was about to accuse and saw the scene in  the soup kitchen saw otis amber cooking soup for the dirty hungry men
no answer theo said sitting down
8   sydelle pulaski victim angela wexler person  sydelle was dressed for the occasion in red and white stripes
leaning on crutches decorated with white stars on a field of blue to match the cast on her ankle she hummed into a pitch pipe and began to sing one note above the pitch she played
o beautiful for spacious skies for amber waves of grain for purple mountain majesties above the fruited plain
what a spectacle she made her wide rear end sticking out singing in that tuneless nasal voice
the derisive smiles soon faded as pair by pair the heirs heard their code words sung
america
america
god shed his grace on thee and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea
such a beautiful song grace wexler slurred but the others sat in somber silence
even turtle thought table eight had won
what is your answer ed plum asked
our answer sydelle pulaski announced with certainty is otis amber the heirs listened to the lawyer read the next document but their eyes stayed fixed on table eights answer otis amber
thirteenth okay folks there will be a short break before the big winner is announced
berthe erica crow please rise and go to the kitchen for the refreshments
dazed with fear crow rose
the thirteenth section
thirteen was an unlucky number
judge ford told sandy to follow her
hey crow old pal do me a favor and fill this for me he said handing her his flask as they left through the door
ill go on the wagon starting tomorrow
promise angela left the room too concerned over crows trancelike state
turtle followed angela to make sure she didnt end up in the fireworks room again
the judge remained seated watching the remaining heirs who were watching otis amber
the delivery boy had had enough of their suspicions he swept a pointed finger across their range imitating the sound of a machine gun ratatattattattat crow and angela came back with two large trays turtle returned emptyhanded puzzled but much relieved
the judge joined denton deere and chris at table three bringing a plate of small cakes with her
none of the heirs  have had plastic surgery as far as i can tell the intern remarked
but your partner sure could have used some the judge studied sandy mcsouthers prizefighters face as he leaned against the open doorway
their eyes met and he lifted his flask in salute
anybody want a drink sure grace wexler replied with a giggle but jake gave her a cup of strong black coffee instead
we must keep our wits about us mr mcsouthers judge ford said walking toward him
sam westing has not made his final move nothing like scotch to clear the head he replied
he took a long swig coughed wiped his mouth on the sleeve of his uniform and glared at crow with narrowed watery eyes
theo grinned down at the chess table
white had made another move a careless move
he licked the cake crumbs from his fingers wiped his hand on a westing paper tea napkin and took his opponents queen from the board
at least he had won the chess game
perched on the corner of table eight the young lawyer tried to start a conversation with angela ignoring sydelle pulaski who twice asked surely you must have the answer mr
plum she nudged her partner
surely you must have the answer mr plum angela repeated sweetly
oh of course at least i assume i do he replied
my instructions are to open the documents one by one at the scheduled time he checked his watch
oops he was one minute late
ed plum hurried to the billiard table tore open the next envelope and pulled out the document cutting his finger on the papers edge
fourteenth go directly to the library
do not pass go
24   wrong all wrong  grace wexler clung unsteadily to mr hoos arm
where are we going who knows hoo replied
we didnt even pass go partner sat with partner at the long library table moaning with impatience as ed plum opened another envelope removed a tagged key tried to unlock the top righthand desk drawer reread the tag unlocked the upper lefthand drawer and found the next document fifteenth wrong
wrong
all answers are  what sydelle pulaski cried
i repeat wrong
all answers are wrong
partnerships are canceled you are on your own
alone
the lawyer will leave and return with the authorities at the appointed time
and  time is running out
hurry find the name before the one who took my life takes another
remember it is not what you have its what you dont have that counts
madame hoo knew from the shifting eyes that a bad person was in the room
she was the bad person
they would find out soon
the crutch lady had her writingbook back but all those pretty things she was going to sell they wanted them back too
she would be punished
soon
how much time do we have turtle asked
ed plum left the library without answering
and locked the door
oh my flora baumbach ran to the french doors
they opened
sydelle pulaski complained of a chill and the dressmaker had to shut the doors but she left them unlatched just in case
mr hoo said the tea tasted funny maybe they had all been poisoned
denton deere diagnosed paranoia
the doorman who was pacing the room replied that anyone who was not paranoid after being told that the murderer would kill again was really crazy
he stopped to pat turtles slumped shoulders
cheer up my friend the games not over yet sandy whispered
you can still win
i hope you do otis amber told everyone to sit where he could watch them
theo rose
i think its about time we played as a team and shared our clues and shared the inheritance  with the murderer
well all right
agreed
sydelle pulaski still thought the answer had something to do with america the beautiful does anybody have a clue word that is not in the song im not sure doug said mischievously
sing it again no one cared for that idea
it is not what you have its what you dont have that counts jake wexler reminded them
maybe some words in the song are missing from the clues that makes sense
does anyone have the word amber mr hoo asked
not again otis amber groaned
you heard the will it said all answers were wrong
well i was one of the wrong answers but mr westing wrote the will before the game began sydelle argued
perhaps he assumed we werent smart enough to find you out so soon judge ford did not interfere otis amber could take care of himself
she had to be prepared to defend crow when the time came
crow sat with her head bowed waiting
no one had the word amber but two pairs had am in their clues
two ams do not an amber make sydelle declared
two ams stand for america america ive got america jake wexler shouted
ive got america ravings of a madman mr hoo thought
the podiatrist could he be the one
jake explained in a calmer voice
the two ams could not stand for america america because one of my clues is america  sandy stood took a long swig from his flask coughed then spoke in a hoarse voice
were getting nowhere
why doesnt everybody hand in their clues so ms pulaski can arrange them in order and we can see whats missing her eyes narrowed with suspicion the judge watched sandy collect the clues
just write them out again he said to turtle who had eaten the originals
then he placed the paper squares before the secretary and resumed his seat
what was her partner doing
why was he playing into westings hands
he knows the answer he knows hes leading the heirs to crow
again the judge studied the doormans battered face the scars the bashedin nose the hard blue eyes under those taped spectacles
the baggy uniform
everyone was given the perfect partner chris said
chris was right
she was paired with the one person who could confound her plans manipulate her moves keep her from the truth
her partner sandy mcsouthers was the only heir she had not investigated
her partner sandy mcsouthers was sam westing
the secretary quickly arranged the clues in order o beautiful for spacious skies for am waves of grain for purple mountain majesties above fruited plain america am god shed his grace on thee and n thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea  the missing words sydelle pulaski announced are ber the erica and crow
berthe erica crow crow paled
judge ford stood
may i have everyones attention
thank you
please listen very carefully to what i have to say
we found the answer to sam westings puzzle now what are we going to do
remember we have no evidence of any kind against this unfortunate woman
we dont even have proof that sam westing was murdered
can we accuse an innocent woman of a murder that has never been proved
crow is our neighbor and our helper
can we condemn her to a life imprisonment just to satisfy our own greed
for money promised in an improbable and illegal will
if so we are guilty of a far greater crime than the accused
berthe erica crows only crime is that her name appears in a song
our crime would be sellingyes i said selling selling for profitthe life of an innocent helpless human being the judge paused to let her words sink in then she turned to her partner
her voice hardened
as for the master of this vicious game… she paused
whats happening to him uhuhuhhh sandys hand flew to his throat
he struggled to his feet redfaced and gasping and crashed to the floor in eyebulging agony
jake wexler and denton deere hurried to his aid
theo pounded on the door shouting for help
ed plum unlocked the door and two strange men rushed past him
one carrying a doctors bag quickly limped on crooked legs to the side of the writhing doorman
im doctor sikes
everyone please move away  the heirs heard a low groan a rasping rattle…then nothing
sandy
sandy turtle screamed pushing through the restraining hands
she looked down on the doorman sprawled at her feet
his face was twisted in rigid pain his mouth gaped over the chipped front tooth
the taped glasses had fallen from his blue eyes that were locked in an unseeing stare
suddenly his body straightened in one last violent twitch
his right eye closed then opened again and sandy moved no more
hes dead doctor sikes said gently turning her away
dead judge ford repeated numbly
how could she have been so wrong
so very wrong
a sob tore through turtles soul as she ran to babas comforting arms
baba baba i dont want to play anymore the second stranger the sheriff of westing county herded them back to the game room
without thinking the heirs seated themselves at the assigned tables
turtle sat quietly it was flora baumbachs turn to weep
crow waited
only the throbbing veins in her tightlyclasped hands told of her torment
excuse me sir ed plum said
i realize this may seem inappropriate but according to samuel w westings will i must read another document on the hour the sheriff checked his watch
what kind of a madhouse is this
and theres something mighty fishy about this cocky kidlawyer calling in the middle of dinner insisting that i hurry right over
that was half an hour before anybody died
go ahead he grumbled
plum cleared his throat three times under the sheriffs suspicious glare
sixteenth i samuel w westing of westingtown born sam windy windkloppel of watertown i had to change my name for business purposes
after all who would buy a product called windkloppels toilet tissues
would you
do hereby declare that if no one wins this will is null and void
so hurry hurry hurry step right up and collect your prize
the lawyer will count off five minutes
good luck and a happy fourth of july
windkloppel did someone say windkloppel grace wexler slurred
i knew westing wasnt an immigrants name sydelle pulaski said
i knew it the man was insane denton deere diagnosed
shhh
they were struggling with their conscience
millions and millions of dollars just for naming her name
one minute is up
the heirs stared at the answer berthe erica crow
a religious fanatic maybe even crazy but a murderer
they had no evidence that westing was murdered the judge said so
crow waited
she had not suffered enough for her sins her penance was yet to begin
two minutes are up
two hundred million dollars turtle thought but who gets it
the last part the lawyer read wasnt very businesslike
besides she could never peach on anybody not even crow
who cares about anything anyhowsandy is dead sandy was her friend now shell never see him againever
judge ford tried not to look at the empty chair at her table mcsouthers chair
her one concern was the safety of crow
the judge watched the heirs and waited
crow waited
three minutes are up
westing wasnt murdered the judge said so but what about sandy
he was drinking from the flask crow filled and he died choking
poison
crow felt the eyes on her
the hating eyes
they scoffed at her beliefs they joked about her soup kitchen
only two people here mattered to her
she was so tired so tired of waiting
of waiting
four minutes are up
the answer is berthe erica crow no angela cried
no no shes crazy otis amber shouted
she doesnt know what shes saying yes i do otis crow said flatly and repeated her statement the answer is berthe erica crow she rose and turned to the confused lawyer
i am berthe erica crow
i am the answer and i am the winner
i give half of my inheritance to otis amber to be used for the good salvation soup kitchen
i give the rest of the money to angela  25   westings wake  sandy was dead
crow had been arrested
the fourteen remaining heirs of samuel w westing sat in judge fords living room wondering what had happened
at least the guilt is not on our hands mr hoo said trying to convince himself that a clear conscience was worth two hundred million dollars
crows going to jail otis amber wailed and all you do is pat yourself on the back for not being a stoolie let me remind you that crow confessed sydelle pulaski reminded him
crow only confessed to being the answer nothing more angela said pressing her hand against the tearing pain in her cheek
even if sam westing wasnt murdered like the judge said doug hoo argued there was nothing wrong with sandy until he drank from the flask crow filled if crow is innocent theo said that means the murderer is still here in this room flora baumbach tightened her grip on turtle who was nestled in her arms
poor crow otis amber muttered poor crow poor sandy you should say turtle responded angrily
sandys the one whos dead
sandy was my friend you should have remembered that before you kicked him denton deere remarked
i never kicked sandy never  the intern turned sideways in his chair in case of attack but the kicker stayed slumped in sadness
well someone kicked him today
that was one mean bruise he had on his shin thats a lie thats a disgusting lie turtle shouted
the only person i kicked today was barney northrup and he deserved it
i didnt even see sandy until tonight at the westing house
right baba thats right flora baumbach said handing turtle a westing facial tissue
but turtle was not about to cry again in front of everybody like a baby
if only she could forget how he looked suffering dying the twisted body the chipped tooth that horrible twitch that one eye that was the worst that one eye blinking
sandy used to wink at her like that when he was alive
when he was alive
turtle blew her nose loudly to keep from sobbing
sandy was my friend too theo said
i was playing chess with him in the game room but he didnt know i knew why is everybody lying turtle slumped further into flora baumbachs arms
sandy was her friend not theos
and sandy didnt know how to play chess
the judge too was surprised
how can you be certain it was mr mcsouthers you were playing with theo thats what partners are for
doug watched the chess table to see who was moving the white pieces theo replied
again the track star thrust his imnumberone fingers high in the air
dumb jock thought mr hoo
doesnt he realize this is a wake
but he is the champ
my sons the champ
doug win said madame hoo
they did not suspect her anymore
good very good
but it was so sad about the door guard
theo went on in a mournful voice
im sort of glad sandy didnt go back to the chessboard after my last move
he never knew he lost the game did you checkmate him the judge asked
could she have been right about mcsouthers after all
no
a disguise was one thing but sam westing lose a game of chess
never
well not exactly checkmate theo replied but sandy would have had to resign
i took his queen the queens sacrifice
the famous westing trap
judge ford was certain now but there were still too many unanswered questions
im afraid greed got the best of you theo
by taking whites queen you were tricked into opening your defense
i know ive lost a few games that way myself theo recalled the position of the chessmen thankful that his skin was too dark to reveal his blushing
turtle almost smiled
that theo thinks hes so smart well sandy showed him sandy beat him at chess
but sandy doesnt play chess
and she never kicked him either
bucktoothed barney northrup was the one she kicked not sandy
but sandy had the sore shin
bucktoothed chiptoothed the crooked false teeth in the dentists office sandys dentist
cheer up my friend the games not over
you can still win
i hope you do those were the last words sandy said to her
he winked when he said that
winked
one eye winked
dead sandy had winked at her
sandy had winked
oh my flora baumbach exclaimed as turtle suddenly bolted from her arms
angela could i see your copy of the will angela handed it over she could not refuse her sister anything now
turtle leaned against the dark window poring over sydelle pulaskis transcript of the will first
i returned to live among my friends and my enemies
i came home to seek my heir aware that in doing so i faced death
and so i did
to seek my heir turtle repeated to herself
today i have gathered together my nearest and dearest my sixteen nieces and nephews sit down grace windsor wexler
to view the body of your uncle sam for the last time
tomorrow its ashes will be scattered to the four winds
winds
windkloppel turtle said aloud
her mother had been right all along about being related to sam westing
windkloppel grace mumbled
jake patted her head
windkloppel the judge repeated
at least she could explain that
crow married a man named windkloppel who then changed his name to westing
berthe erica crow is the former wife of samuel w westing
they had one child a daughter who drowned the night before her wedding
it was  rumored that she killed herself rather than marry the man her mother had chosen for her
if sam westing blamed his wife for their daughters death then the sole purpose of this game was to punish crow crow was sam westings exwife
the heirs found that hard to believe
then why would mr westing give her a chance to inherit the estate theo asked
mmaybe he wanted his enemies to forggive him chris said
ha said mr hoo one of the enemies
turtle read on second
i samuel w westing hereby swear that i did not die of natural causes
my life was taken from meby one of you
the police are helpless
the culprit is far too cunning to be apprehended for this dastardly deed
what does dastardly mean oh my flora baumbach was relieved to hear jake wexler define the word as cowardly i alone know the name
now it is up to you
cast out the sinner let the guilty rise and confess
third
who among you is worthy to be the westing heir
help me
my  soul shall roam restlessly that one is found
until  for the first time since sandy died turtle smiled
judge ford sat in glassyeyed thought elbows propped on the desk top her chin resting on her folded hands
why indeed was crow an heir
sam westing could have pointed his clues at the sunset towers cleaning woman without naming her an heir
crows not going to inherit anything not if shes in jail for murder otis amber complained bitterly
all your talk about chess and sacrificing queens
crows the one whos been sacrificed what did you say the judge asked
i said crows the one whos been sacrificed uttering a low groan judge ford sank her head in her hands
the queens sacrifice
she had fallen for it again
westing had sacrificed his queen crow distracting the players from the real game
sam westing was dead but somehow or other he would make his last move
she knew it she felt it deep in her bones
sam westing had won the game
stupid stupid stupid the heirs stared in amazement
first they are told that samuel w westing was married to their cleaning woman now a judge is calling herself stupid
it couldnt be true
sam westing wasnt stupid denton deere declared
he was insane
the last party of the will was sheer lunacy
happy fourth of july it said
this is november its november fifteenth otis amber cried
its poor crows birthday  turtle looked up from the will
crows birthday
sandy had bought a striped candle for his wifes birthday a threehour candle
the game is still on
sam westing came back to seek his heir
you can still win
i hope you do he said
how
how
it is not what you have its what you dont have that counts
whatever it was she didnt have shed have to find it soon
without letting the others know what she was looking for
judge ford id like to call my first witness  26   turtles trial  hoo was furious
havent we had enough gameplaying he complained
and led by a confessed bomber no less judge ford rapped for silence with the walnut gavel presented to her by associates on her appointment to a higher court
higher court
this was the lowest court she had ever presided at a thirteenyearold lawyer a court stenographer who records in polish and the judge in african robes
oh well she had played sam westings game now she would play turtles game
the similarity was astounding turtle not only looked like her uncle sam she acted like him
ladies and gentlemen turtle began i stand before this court to prove that samuel w westing is dead and that sandy mcsouthers is dead but crow didnt do it pacing the floor hands behind her back she confronted each of the heirs in turn with a hard stare
the heirs stared back not knowing if they were the jury or the accused
grace wexler blinked up at her daughter
whos that the district attorney jake replied
go back to sleep now frowning now smiling a secret smile turtle acted the part of every brilliant lawyer she had seen on television who was about to win an impossible case
the only flaw in her imitation was an occasional rapid twist of her head
she liked the grownup feeling of shorter hair swishing around her face
let me begin at the beginning she began
on september first we moved into sunset towers
two months later on halloween smoke was seen rising from the chimney of the deserted westing house her first witness would be the person most likely to have watched the house that day
i call chris theodorakis to the stand chris lay a calm hand on the bible and swore to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
what fun
you are a birdwatcher mr theodorakis are you not yes were you birdwatching on october thirtyfirst yes did you see anyone enter the westing house i ssaw ssomebody who limped good now she was getting somewhere
who was that limping person it was ddoctor sikes thank you you are excused turtle turned to her audience
doctor sikes was sam westings friend a witness to the will and his accomplice in this game
on the day in question he limped into the westing house to build a fire in the fireplace
why her next witness might answer that
judge ford instructed the witness to remove his aviators helmet
his gray hair was tousled but barbered
and place your gun in the custody of the court oh my flora baumbach gasped as otis amber unzipped his plastic jacket pulled a revolver from his shoulder holster and handed it over to the judge who locked the gun in her desk drawer
turtle was as startled as the other tenants
mr
amber she began bravely it seems that we are not all who we say we are
in other words who exactly are you i am a licensed private investigator then why were you disguised as an idiot delivery boy it was my disguise turtle was dealing with a practiced witness
mr
amber who employed you thats privileged information the judge interceded
it would be best to cooperate mr amber
for crows sake i had three clients samuel w westing barney northrup and judge j j ford turtle stumbled over her next question
what were you hired to do and when and what did you find out
tell us everything you know it was unsettling to see otis amber act like a normal human being
twenty years ago after his wife left him samuel w westing hired me to find crow keep her out of trouble and make sure she never used the westing name
i assumed this disguise for that purpose
i mailed in my reports and received a monthly check from the westingtown bank until last week when i was notified that my services were no longer needed
but crow still needs me and ill stick by her no matter what
ive grown fond of the woman weve been together such a long time how and why did barney northrup hire you amber is second in the phone book under private investigators maybe joe aarons phone was busy that day
anyhow barney northrup wanted me to investigate six people what six judge j j ford george theodorakis james hoo gracie windkloppel flora baumbach and sybil pulaski
i made a mistake on the last one i wasnt aware of the mixup until i looked into crows early life for the judge
it seems i confused a sybil pulaski with a sydelle pulaski would you please repeat that the court stenographer asked
sydelle pulaski otis amber repeated then turned to the judge
i couldnt tell you about crows relationship to sam westingconflict of interest you understand
judge ford understood very well
sam westing had predicted every move she would make
thats why otis amber with his privileged information was one of the heirs that and to convince crow the queen to play the game
turtle had more questions
are you saying that barney northrup didnt ask you to investigate denton deere or crow or sandy thats right
denton deere turned up in my report on gracie windkloppelthe wexlers
barney northrup said he was looking to hire a cleaning woman for sunset towers  good pay and a small apartment so i recommended crow
i dont know how sandy got the doormans job mr
amber you were also hired by judge ford i assume to find out who everybody really was
did you investigate all sixteen heirs for the judge i didnt investigate the judge or her partner the judge bristled at the reminder of her stupidity
therefore turtle continued you have never investigated the man we knew as sandy mcsouthers for any of your clients never one more question it was the question she had planned to ask before learning that otis amber was not who he seemed to be
on the afternoon of halloween when we were watching the smoke in the westing house chimney you told a story about a corpse on an oriental rug i saw it grace wexler cried i saw him turtle forgot the rules of the court and hurried to her mother
who did you see mom
who
who terrified by the whos madame hoo slipped away
the doorman grace replied lifting her dazed face to her husband
he was dead
on an oriental rug jake
it was awful jake stroked his wifes hair
i know gracie i know turtle returned to her witness
mr
amber did you tell that spooky story to dare one of us to go to the westing house that night not really
sandy told me the story that morning and we decided to scare you kids with it being halloween  thank you mr amber you may step down step down was a term used in court the floor was level here
turtle turned to her baffled audience
a fire was started in the fireplace to call attention to the deserted house
then a spooky story was told to dare someone to go into the house
that someone was me
i sneaked in the house followed dr sikes whispers and found the corpse of samuel w westing in bed
i now call d denton deere to the stand turtle stared at her most unfavorite heir
intern deere you saw the body of samuel w westing in the coffin
did he appear to have been poisoned i could not say he was embalmed you are under oath intern deere
do you swear that the body of samuel w westing was embalmed what kind of a trick question was that
i cannot swear to it no
i did not examine the body in the coffin could the body in the coffin which you did not examine have been no body at all
could it have been a wax dummy dressed in the costume of uncle sam i am not an expert on wax dummies yes or no yes its possible anything is possible whats the brat driving at
or is she just trying to make a fool of me
intern deere you may not be an expert in wax dummies but you are an expert in medical diagnosis and you did examine the body of sandy mcsouthers
correct yes to the first question no to the second
i did not examine sandy i tried to make him comfortable until help arrived
he was still alive when doctor sikes took over  turtle turned quickly to conceal her smile
but surely you saw enough symptoms to make one of your famous diagnosises she peered at the judge from the corner of her eye
that last word didnt sound right
coronary thrombosis the intern diagnosed but thats just an educated guess
in simple language heart attack then sandy could not have died of an overdose of lemon juice which is what i saw crow put in his flask turtle could have called on angela to testify to that but she didnt want her screwy sister confessing all over the place
i never heard of anyone dying as a result of lemon juice consumption the expert replied
one more question intern deere
do you swear that sandy had a bruise on his shin resulting from a kick absolutely
i should know having been the recipient of such a kick myself you may step down i call sydelle pulaski to the stand
sydelle pulaski overcome with excitement the secretary had to be helped to her feet for the oathtaking
ms
pulaski i must compliment you on your good thinking in taking down the will in shorthand professional habit this looks professional all right
the typing is perfect well almost perfect
it seems you left out the last word in section three  the estate is at the crossroads
the heir who wins the windfall will be the one who finds the  finds the what ms pulaski
finds the what sydelle squirmed under turtles hard stare
leave it to the brat to discover my one error
there was so much talking i couldnt hear the last word come now ms pulaski you claim to be a professional hounding the witness and doing it quite well judge ford thought coming to the secretarys defense
i dont think anyone heard the word turtle
mr mcsouthers made a joke about ashes at that point you are excused ms pulaski turtle said offhandedly her eyes on the will
the judge was right
sandy had joked about ashes scattered to the winds
winds windy windkloppel no it still didnt make sense
it is not what you have its what you dont have that countsmaybe no word was ever there
she read on fourth
hail to thee oh land of opportunity
you have made me the son of poor immigrants rich powerful and respected
so take stock in america my heirs and sing in praise of this generous land
you too may strike it rich who dares play the westing game
fifth
sit down your honor and read the letter this brilliant  young attorney will now hand over to you
judge ford could you introduce as evidence the letter that brilliant young attorney handed over to you it is just the usual certification of sanity signed by doctor sikes the judge replied as she removed the envelope from her files
but the letter was gone the envelope now contained a receipt check received november 1 check received november 15 total amount paid by judge ford cost of educating josiejo ford amount owed to sam westing  5000 5000 10000 10000 0  im afraid the original letter has been replaced by a personal message
it has no bearing on this case and… yes please a trembling madame hoo stood before the judge
for to go to china she said timidly setting a scarftied bundle on the desk
weeping softly the thief shuffled back to her seat
the judge unknotted the scarf and let the flowered silk float down around the booty her fathers railroad watch a pearl necklace cuff links a pin and earrings set a clock
grace wexlers silver cross never did turn up
my pearls flora baumbach exclaimed with delight
wherever did you find them madame hoo
im so grateful madame hoo did not understand why the round little lady was smiling at her
cautiously she peered through her fingers
oh
the other people did not smile
they know she is bad
and mr hoo his anger is drowned in shame
perhaps stealing is not considered stealing in china sydelle pulaski said in a clumsy gesture of kindness
the judge rapped her gavel
let us continue with the case on hand
are you ready counselor yes your honor in a minute turtle approached the frightened thief
here you can keep it with shaking hands madame hoo took the mickey mouse clock from turtle and clutched the priceless treasure to her bosom
thank you good girl thank you thank you thats okay the heirs were anxious for the trial to continue
they pitied the poor woman but the scene was embarrassing
one half hour to go
turtle was so close to winning she could feel it taste it but still the answer eluded her
ladies and gentlemen who was sam westing she began
he was poor windy windkloppel the son of immigrants
he was rich sam westing the head of a huge paper company
he was a happy man who played games
he was a sad man whose daughter killed herself
he was a lonely man who moved to a faraway island
he was a sick man who returned home to see his friends and relatives before he died
and he did die but not when we thought he did
sam westing was still alive when the will was read the judge rapped for order
turtle continued
the obituary probably phoned in to the newspaper by westing himself mentioned two interesting facts
one sam westing was never seen after his car crashed
two sam westing acted in fourth of july pageants fooling everybody with his clever disguises
therefore i submit that sam westing was not only alive sam westing was disguised as one of his own heirs
no one would recognize him
with that face bashed in from the car crash his disguise could be simple a baggy uniform a chipped front tooth broken eyeglasses sandy
does she mean sandy
the judge had to pound her gavel several times
yes ladies and gentlemen turtle went on sam westing was none other than our dear friend sandy the doorman
but sam westing did not drink you say
neither did sandy
i used his flask on halloween and there was a funny aftertaste in my pop but not of whiskey i know how whiskey tastes because i use it for toothaches
it was medicine
sandy was a sick man and the flask was part of his disguise but it also contained the medicine that kept him alive turtle surveyed the stupefied audience
good they bought her little fib
as i said earlier i saw crow fill the flask with lemon juice in the kitchen but i saw something even more interesting on my way back to the game room i saw sandy coming out of the library
sam westing as sandy wrote the last part of the will after the answers were given then locked it in the library desk with a duplicate key
but what about the murder you ask turtle said even though no one had asked
there was no murder
the word murder was first mentioned by sandy to put us off the track
i did not die of natural causes the will says my life was taken from meby one of you
sam westings life was taken from  him when he became sandy mcsouthers
and sandy died when his medicine ran out turtle paused in a pretense of letting the heirs mull over her last words trying to figure out what to do next
why did turtle leave out barney northrup the judge wondered
she knows northrup and mcsouthers were the same man because of the bruised shin
either she doesnt want to confound the jury or she has no more idea than i have why sam westing had to play two roles
why did sam westing have to play two roles turtle wondered
he had a big enough part as the doorman without playing the realestate man as well
why two roles
no not two three
windy windkloppel took three names one samuel w westing two barney northrup three sandy mcsouthers
the judge had a question surely mr mcsouthers could have had his prescription refilled or are you implying he committed suicide pardon me turtle was searching the will
the estate is at the crossroads
the heir who wins the windfall will be the one who finds the fourth
thats it that has to be it the heir who wins the windfall will be the one who finds the fourth
windy windkloppel took four names and she knew who the fourth name was
keep calm turtle alice tabitharuth wexler
slowly very slowly turn  toward the judge act dumb and ask her to repeat the question
im sorry your honor would you repeat the question turtle knows something
the judge had seen that expression before
sam westing used to look like that just before he won a game
i asked if you consider sandys death a suicide no maam turtle said sadly
very sadly
sandy mcsoutherssam westing suffered terribly from a fatal disease
he was a dying man who chose his time to die
let me read from the will sixth
before you proceed to the game room there will be one minute of silent prayer for your good old uncle sam
ladies and gentlemen heirs for we all inherited something let us bow our heads in silent prayer for our benefactor sam westing alias sandy the doorman crow otis amber leaped to his feet as ed plum led the cleaning woman through the door
27   a happy fourth  his aviators helmet again flapping over his ears otis amber danced up to his soupkitchen companion flung his arms around the taut body and squeezed her tightly
hey crow old pal old pal old pal  they said i was innocent otis
they said i was innocent she replied vaguely
angela too wanted to hug her in welcome but closeness was not possible for either of them
instead angela offered a crooked smile
crow nodded and lowered her eyes only to raise them to madame hoo clutching a mickey mouse clock
things very good madame hoo said extending her free hand and shaking crows hand up and down
it was all a regrettable mistake ed plum explained to the judge
can you imagine that sheriff wanted to arrest me not crowme edgar jennings plumhe wanted to arrest the attorney
fortunately the coroner determined that mr mcsouthers died of a heart attack as did samuel w westing then turtles right theo said
there was no murder
the coroner was part of the plot ed plum had no idea what theo was talking about
masking his ignorance with arrogance he continued
i had my suspicions about this entire affair from the start
i came here for one reason only to announce my resignation from all matters regarding the westing estate with sincere apologies to all concerned wasnt there a last document judge ford asked knowing that sam westing had to make his last move
yes but as i no longer take a legal interest… please turn it over to the court baffled by the word court the lawyer set the envelope on the desk and found his way out of sunset towers
without once clearing her throat judge ford proceeded to read the final page of the will of samuel w westing
seventeenth  goodbye my heirs
thanks for the fun and games
i can rest in peace knowing i was loved as your jolly doorman
eighteenth i samuel w westing otherwise known as sandy mcsouthers and others do hereby give and bequeath all the property and possessions in my name as follows to all of you in equal shares the deed to sunset towers and to my former wife berthe erica crow the tenthousanddollar check forfeited by table one and two tenthousanddollar checks endorsed by j j ford and alexander mcsouthers
nineteenth  the sun has set on your uncle sam
happy birthday crow
and to all of my heirs a very happy fourth of july
judge ford set the document down
thats it thats it
what about the two hundred million dollars the heirs wanted to know
we lost the game the judge explained staring at turtle her face a mask of sad childlike innocence as she nestled once again in flora baumbachs arms
i think  turtle rose and walked to the side window seeking the westing house which stood invisible in the moonclouded night
hurry up uncle sam i cant keep up this act much longer
the candle must have burned through the last stripe by now
behind her the discontented heirs grumbled he made fools of us all
he played us like puppets
he was a ggood mman
he was a vengeful man a hateful man
windkloppel
he tricked us the cheat
a madman stark raving mad
oh my oh my just listen to you flora baumbach said
you each have ten thousand dollars more than you started with and an apartment building to boot
the man is dead so why not think the best boom
boom
boom
happy fourth of july turtle shouted as the first rockets lit up the westing house lit up the sky
boomboomboomboom
boom
the heirs gathered around turtle at the window
boom
stars of all colors bursting into the night silver pinwheels spinning golden lances upupboom
crimson flashes flashing blasting scarlet showers boom
emerald rain boom
boom
orange flames red flames leaping from the windows sparking the turrets firing the trees… boom cried madame hoo clapping her hands with delight
the great winter fireworks extravaganza as it came to be called lasted only fifteen minutes
twenty minutes later the westing house had burned to the ground
happy birthday crow otis amber said reaching for her hand
the orange glow of the morning sun had just begun its climb up the glass front of sunset towers when turtle set out to collect the prize
she pedaled north past the cliff still smoldering with the charred remains of the westing house
reaching the crossroads she turned into the narrow lane whose twisting curves mimicked the shoreline
the heir who wins the windfall will be the one who finds the fourth
it was so simple once you knew what you were looking for
sam westing barney northrup sandy mcsouthers west north south
now she was on her way to meet the fourth identity of windy windkloppel
she could probably have figured out the address too instead of looking it up in the westingtown phone bookthere it was number four sunrise lane
a long driveway its privacy guarded by tall spruce led to the modern mansion of the newlyelected chairman of the board of westing paper products corporation
turtle climbed the stairs rang the bell and waited
the door opened
turtle felt her first grip of panic as she confronted the crippled doctor
could she have been wrong
id like to see mr eastman please she said nervously
tell him turtle wexler is here mr
eastman is expecting you doctor sikes said
go straight down the hall  the hall had an inlaid marble floor no oriental rugs
reaching its end she entered a paneled library this one filled with books
there he was sitting at his desk
julian r eastman rose
he looked stern
and very proper
he wore a gray business suit with a vest a striped tie
his shoes were shined
he limped as he walked toward her not the crooked limp of doctor sikes just a small limp a painful limp
again turtle was gripped by panic
he seemed so different so important
she shouldnt have kicked him the barney northrup him
he was coming closer
his watery blue eyes stared at her over his rimless halfglasses
hard eyes
his teeth were white not quite even no one would ever guess they were false
he was smiling
he wasnt angry with her he was smiling
hi sandy turtle said
i won  28  and then…  turtle never told
she went to the library every saturday afternoon she explained which was partly true
make your move turtle you dont want to be late for the wedding the ceremony was held in shin hoos restaurant
grace wexler recovered from a worldrecord hangover draped a white cloth over the liquor bottles and set a spray of roses on the bar
no drinks would be served today
radiant in her wedding gown of white heirloom lace the bride walked down the aisle past the tables of wellwishers  on the arm of jake wexler
mr hoo the best man beamed with pride at her light footsteps as he supported the kneeknocking nervous groom
a fine red line of a scar marked angelas cheek but she looked content and lovely as ever in her pale blue bridesmaids gown
the other bridesmaid wore pink and yellow with matching crutches
the guests cried during the wedding and laughed during the reception
flora baumbach smiled and cried at the same time
you did a good job altering the wedding dress baba turtle said which made the dressmaker cry even harder
a toast to the bride and groom jake announced raising his glass of ginger ale
to crow and otis amber the heirs of uncle sam westing clinked glasses with the members of the good salvation soup kitchen sobered up for this happy occasion
to crow and otis amber apartment 4d was bare
for the last time judge ford stared out the side window to the cliff where the westing house once stood
she would never solve the westing puzzle perhaps it was just as well
her debt would finally be repaidwith interest the money she received from the sale of her share of sunset towers would pay for the education of another youngster just as sam westing had paid for hers
hi judge ford i ccame to say ggoodbye chris said wheeling himself through the door
oh hello chris that was nice of you but why arent you studying
wheres your tutor she looked at the binoculars hanging from his neck
you havent been birdwatching again have you
there will be plenty of time for birds later first you must catch up on your studies if you want  to get into a good school good heavens she was beginning to sound like mr hoo
will you ccome to see mme chris asked
it ggets sort of lonely with theo away at ccollege the judge gave him one of her rare smiles
he was a bright youngster real smart sandy had said he had a good future sandy had said that too he needed her influence and the extra money but she might smother him with her demands
ill see you when i can and ill write to you chris
i promise hoos little footeze patent pending was selling well in drugstores and shoe repair shops
once we capture the milwaukee market ill take you to china james hoo promised his business partner
okay madame hoo replied toting up accounts on her abacus
no hurry
she had many friends in sunset towers now
and no more cooking no more tight dresses slit up her thigh
her husband had bought her a nice pantsuit to wear when they called on customers and for her birthday doug had given her one of his medals to wear around her neck
the secretary to the president of schultz sausages was back on the job
her ankle mended sydelle pulaski had discarded her crutches
she had all the attention she could handle without them after all she was an heiress now
it wasnt polite to ask how much but everyone knew sam westing had millions
of course she could retire to florida she said but what would poor mr schultz do without her
and then one unforgettable friday mr schultz himself took her to lunch
jake wexler had given up his private practice both private practices now that he had been appointed consultant to the governors inquiry panel for a state lottery thanks to a recommendation by judge ford
grace was proud of him and his daughters were doing well
in fact everything was fine just fine
hoos on first was a great success
grace wexler the new owner offered free meals to the sports figures who came to town and everyone wanted to eat where the athletes ate
the restaurants one windowless wall was covered with autographed photographs of brewers packers and bucks
grace straightened the framed picture of a smiling champion signed to grace w wexler who serves the numberone food in towndoug hoo
she certainly was a lucky woman a respected restaurateur wife of a state official and mother of the cleverest kid who ever lived
turtle was going to be somebody someday
a narrow scar remained and would always remain on angelas cheek
it was slightly raised and she had developed a habit of running her fingers along it as she pored over her books
enrolled in college again she lived at home to save money for the years of medical school ahead
she had returned the engagement ring to denton deere she had not seen him since crows wedding
ed plum had stopped calling after ten refusals
angela had neither the time nor the desire for a social life what with studying her weekly shopping date with sydelle and sundays spent helping crow and otis in the soup kitchen
study study study turtle said
angela saw little of her sister who was either at school in flora baumbachs apartment or at the library
hi turtle how come youre so happy today the stock market jumped twentyfive points the newlyweds crow and otis amber moved into the apartment above the good salvation soup kitchen
the storefront mission had been renovated and expanded with the money from the inheritance
grace wexler had supervised the decorations copper pots hung from the ceiling the pews were padded with flowered cushions and fitted with hymnbook pockets and dropleaf trays
there was meat in the soup and fresh bread every day
29   five years pass  the former delivery boy danced into the hoos new lakefront home
lets give a cheer the ambers are here otis came to celebrate dougs victory wearing the old zippered jacket and aviators helmet
he had even let a stubble grow on his chin
the only thing missing was his delivery bike they had come in the soupkitchen van
thank you for the generous donation mr hoo
god bless you crow said
otis and i distributed the innersoles among our people
it helped their suffering greatly she looked worn her skin pulled tight against the fragile bones and she still wore black
mr hoo on the other hand was stouter and less angry
in fact he was almost happy
business was booming
milwaukee loved hoos little footeze and so did chicago and new york and los angeles but he still had not taken his wife to china
theo theodorakis graduate of journalism school cub reporter held up the newspaper hot off the press olympic hero comes home four columns were devoted to the history and achievement of the gold medal winner who had set a new record for the 1500meter run
theo had not actually written the article on the local hero but he had sharpened pencils for the reporter who did
take a bow doug mr hoo said beaming
doug leaped on a table and thrust his index fingers high in the air
im number one he shouted
the olympic gold medal hung from his neck confetti from the parade dotted his hair
the westing heirs cheered
hello jake im glad you could come sunny as madame hoo was now called said shaking the hand of the chairman of the state gambling commission
boom jake wexler replied
hello angela denton deere had grown a thick moustache
he was a neurologist
he had never married
hello denton angelas golden hair was tied in a knot on the nape of her neck
she wore no makeup
she was  completing her third year of medical school
its been a long time remember me sydelle pulaski wore a red and white polka dot dress and leaned on a red and white polka dot crutch
she had sprained her knee dancing a tango at the office party
how could i ever forget you ms pulaski denton said
id like you to meet my fiancé conrad schultz president of schultz sausages how do you do judge ford id like you to meet my friend shirley staver chris theodorakis was in his junior year at college
